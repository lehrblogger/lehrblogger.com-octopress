Taken at the northeast corner of Rivington and Essex in the Lower East Side of Manhattan, facing west. Judging from the labels on the buzzer near the door just outside of the right edge of the frame, I believe the sign is there courtesy of a design firm named [dress code][1]. They've got a pretty awesome website, so go check it out, and then go check it out again a few hours later.
