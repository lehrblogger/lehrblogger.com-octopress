This is the portfolio of work I assembled to apply to post-undergraduate internships and graduate school. It was last updated in December 2007, and contains work in a variety of media. Please [download][1] the file (2.8MB) or view it full screen on [SlideShare][2] (click the easel icon in the lower right).
