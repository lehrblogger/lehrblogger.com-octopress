During the Spring 2007 academic quarter, I co-taught a Student-Initiated Course at Stanford with friend and fellow Architectural Design Program student [Joseph Bergen][1]. We organized and lead a team of eight other students in completing a three-dimensional model of Stanford's campus in Sketchup for entry in Google's Build Your Campus in 3D competition. Emphasis was placed on small file sizes to facilitate online accessibility via Google Earth, and we used textured images to create realistic appearances.
