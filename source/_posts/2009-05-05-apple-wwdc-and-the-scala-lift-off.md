I was awarded a student scholarship to attend the annual [Apple Worldwide Developer Conference][1], so I'll be flying to San Francisco in June. According to the website, the event "provides developers and IT professionals with in-depth technical information and hands-on learning about the powerful technologies in iPhone OS and Mac OS X from the Apple engineers who created them." Many of the planned [sessions][2] sound interesting, and I'm also looking forward to the [Apple Design Awards][3]. I'll probably spend the next month working on [Meetapp][4] (rather than [Delvicious][5]) so that I'm better prepared for the iPhone development labs.

I'm also planning to attend the [Scala Lift Off][6] on June 6th, a conference for developers using Scala and the associated web framework Lift. I hope to have more time to talk with some of the people who attended the [Scala BASE][7] meeting at which I [presented][8] my [TwiTerra][9] project in January. Martin Odersky, the creator of Scala, will also be speaking, and my friend Jorge Ortiz plans to attend as well.

I'm excited to go to both events and to visit other friends in California, so I'll be sure to post about them again.
