Several weeks ago I presented my project [Where Do You Go][1] at the [NY Quantified Self Meetup Group][2]'s seventh [Show & Tell][3] at ITP. Evan Creem recorded and edited together videos of the presentations, and mine is below:

If you're interested in self-quantification in general, The NYT Magazine recently ran a good article titled [The Data-Driven Life][4]. About a month ago I received my [Fitbit][5], one of the devices mentioned in the article, and you can see the public data I have collected so far [here][6]. I've been using it primarily to get a sense of how much I actually walk and how little I actually sleep -- two things about which it's slightly too tedious to make daily notes but which still might be interesting to examine in the aggregate.
