*This is my first post about David Nolen's class [Little Computers][1]. We're thinking about the iPhone as a computing device and learning to write applications for it.*

I am going to build an iPhone application for users of [Meetup.com][2] for my primary project in Little Computers. Meetup is a pretty cool company -- if you're unfamiliar, it's worth reading the following and checking out their site.

> Meetup is the world's largest network of local groups. Meetup makes it easy for anyone to organize a local group or find one of the thousands already meeting up face-to-face. More than 2,000 groups get together in local communities each day, each one with the goal of improving themselves or their communities.
> 
> Meetup's mission is to revitalize local community and help people around the world self-organize. Meetup believes that people can change their personal world, or the whole world, by organizing themselves into groups that are powerful enough to make a difference.

I considered many alternative apps to build -- [xkcd][3], [Diplomacy][4], a super simple app for exchanging contact info, a very complex app for music sharing, and others -- but settled on this one. It seems like something that could be truly useful to a lot of people, doable within the course of the semester, and challenging and interesting to make. The slide deck and sketches I made to present the idea to the class is below.
