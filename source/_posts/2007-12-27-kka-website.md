My final project as an intern at Kevin Kennon Architect in 2008 was a complete re-structuring and re-design of the firm's website. I taught myself Flash/ActionScript 3 and reorganized existing content and design elements to build a full-featured dynamic website. I ensured that it was simple for other employees to add/modify content, and I extensively documented my work to facilitate future improvements.
