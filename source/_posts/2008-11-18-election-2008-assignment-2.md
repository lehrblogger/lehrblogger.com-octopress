The assignment was as follows:

> Please write a 1500-2500 word doc on non-professional political media, outlining what strategic advice you would give a Presidential contender running in 2012 (which is to say, forming an exploratory committee in 2010.)
> 
> Topics can include, but do not need to be limited to: how to reach out to media producers, how to solicit research on your opponent, how to frame or benefit from media in favor of your candidate, how to frame or benefit from media against your opponent, how to neutralize media praising your opponent or attacking you, the difference between media produced in the primary vs. general campaign, and so on.
