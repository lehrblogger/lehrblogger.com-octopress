I am switching over from Blogger to WordPress on my own domain -- lehrblogger.com -- for a variety of reasons including but not limited to: curiosity about WordPress, annoyances with the Blogger interface, and love for the new domain name (Gabriela deserves credit for the idea). I hope you and your RSS feeds will follow me to here!

This theme is driving me a little crazy, but designing my own will be a separate project. All of the old posts and comments have been transferred.
