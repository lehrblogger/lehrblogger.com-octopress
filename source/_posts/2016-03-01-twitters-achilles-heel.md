On the surface, Twitter is doing wonderfully well. They have over 230 million active users, and [growth is healthy][1]. In less than two months their stock has risen steadily to [nearly triple][2] [the IPO price][3], and there are [new advertising opportunies][4] they are just beginning to expore. Both consumers and brands view the product as a global town square where people find news, ideas, and lightweight conversation.

Yet Twitter faces a growing threat from [a horde of upstart messaging apps][24]. [Snapchat][5], [WhatsApp][6], [Kik][7], [WeChat][8], [Line][9], and [Kakao][10] each have at least 100 million users, and pose an existential threat to Twitter in the same way that Facebook was an existential threat to MySpace. This is a classic example of [disruptive innovation][11], as described by Clayton Christensen in his book [The Innovator's Dilemma][12]. If you're unfamiliar, [watch the first ten minutes of this talk][13].

Twitter has had a barebones messaging feature since it launched in 2006, but for years Direct Messages have been hidden in their apps and website. Twitter ignored messaging because it was a commodity feature that was not central to their core broadcasting product, and because it had been historically difficult to monetize. As Christensen might predict, Twitter seemed happy to let those other companies relieve them of the least profitable part of their product, so that they could better focus on what was important to the business.

Meanwhile, the aforementioned messaging apps grew like innovative weeds. Snapchat pioneered [ephemeral social media][17], Line showed that sales of virtual [stickers could generate substantial revenue][18] (and everyone else followed suit), and WhatsApp has shown that people *would actually pay money* for social apps ([$0.99/year][19] adds up over [400 million users][20]). More problematically for Twitter, these apps are branching out into other aspects of social networking: Snapchat recently launched [a broadcast feature called Stories][21], Kik is pushing [a platform that enables third-parties to develop social apps][22], and WeChat offers [a Tweet-like Moments feature][23]. These apps have all been trying to move upmarket into Twitter's profitable social/information broadcasting territory.

Twitter, to its credit, has recently tried to move its messaging product back downmarket. They [resurrected DMs][14] with support for photos and a more prominent placement, but they're [still bizarrely tied to Twitter's follow graph][15] -- my friends might still want me to be able to talk to them even if they don't want to be bothered by all of my public tweets -- despite [experiments with fewer restrictions][16]. These efforts are misdirected, however: Twitter users think of DMs as a last-resort communication method, used only when the matter is urgent (traditionally, DMs would trigger in-app, email, and SMS notifications) or when you don't have the person's email address. And even with the recent changes, Twitter is still thinking of DMs as email, merging the email envelope icon with the messaging chat bubble icon in their new iOS tab bar:

The upstart messaging apps are successful, however, precisely because they are *not* email. DMs must be 'composed', since it takes extra effort to break up a thought into 140-character snippets, while the messaging apps try to replicate the casual, instantaneous nature of face-to-face interaction. Typing notifications, for example, create a sense of mutual presence and attention, while stickers convey emotion when body language cannot. While Twitter could continue to iterate on DMs until it reached feature parity with the other messaging apps, that could overcomplicate the current product. Sometimes people go to Twitter to find out ["what's happening"][24], but sometimes people go to Twitter to talk to other people, and these distinct use cases would be better served by distinct apps. Rather than struggle to teach an old feature new tricks, Twitter should create a new product to compete with the other messaging apps. Fortunately for Twitter, there are several aspects of it's current products it can leverage to create a differentiated experience.

##### Leverage the Existing Social Graph

established username, unique social graph, 

identity platform

other apps only have address book, twitter has interest graph.
interesting feature of dashdash[link to post], footnote to quadrant post

twitter's currently-unique advantage is that it a network for interacting with people you don't already know, unlike google and Facebook and etcetc

facebook and address book are the same, twitter graph is aspirational, people you want to know


##### Seed Conversations with @-Replies

Christensen, compete against non-consumption, conversations people dont have a place to have

subscribe to conversations

Threading - there's nothing wrong with nesting?

##### Degrade Gracefully to DMs

backwards compatibility with DMs

users that opt in receive DMs in messaging app, not as DMs


---

The points of interface with the product are (and always have been) too simple

Twitter is a town square, but all we can do is yell and whisper.
