there's nothing wrong with nesting

sanctity of timeline is gone with promoted tweets,  we can remove @ names from replies

notifications are a shitty way to show unread messages



status updates are becoming commodified

conversations on twitter pinned to the top like promoted tweets


conversation is important as defense. the threat to twitter is not facebook but whatsapp and etc

FB takes threats seriously

facebook : twitter :: twitter whatsapp


facebook was in a catch 22, but the way they reacted to snapchat suggests that they took the threat seriously, which is too their credit. do they spend a billion dollars on every innovative successful app? no

twitter, however, seems indifferent to the quality of interpersonal communication on its platform

google using hangouts to pre populate google+ with photos, get verge or TC link

twitter's currently-unique advantage is that it a network for interacting with people you don't already know, unlike google and Facebook and etcetc

Zawinski's Law
“Every program attempts to expand until it can read mail. Those programs which cannot so expand are replaced by ones which can.” Coined by Jamie Zawinski (who called it the “Law of Software Envelopment”) to express his belief that all truly useful programs experience pressure to evolve into toolkits and application platforms (the mailer thing, he says, is just a side effect of that). It is commonly cited, though with widely varying degrees of accuracy.

me: 1) conversation on twitter sucks, both 2 person (DMs) and groups (@ replies), and it's a strategic vulnerability that they need to fix more urgently than they think
me: because all of the SMS replacement apps are adding statuses
me: maybe i need data from whatsapp/wechat/kik/etc that i dont really have a way to get
me: in order to make that argument
anon: interesting
me: i should be able to subscribe to threads
me: and see decent threaded views
me: and etc
anon: yeah, they haven't really made any improvements on the UI ever
anon: I mean, can I see some stats on who the most active tweeters are in my stream? and maybe mute them sometimes?
me: filtering is maybe a separate problem? but yeah
anon: that company's gotten way too big, I think the UI is unlikely to ever meaningfully change prior to acquisition/IPO
