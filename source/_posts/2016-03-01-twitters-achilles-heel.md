On the surface, Twitter is doing wonderfully well. They have over 230 million active users, and [growth is healthy][1]. In less than two months their stock has risen steadily to [nearly triple][2] [the IPO price][3], and there are [new advertising opportunies][4] they are just beginning to expore. Both consumers and brands view the product as a global town square where people find news, ideas, and lightweight conversation.

Yet Twitter faces a growing threat from [a horde of upstart messaging apps][24]. [Snapchat][5], [WhatsApp][6], [Kik][7], [WeChat][8], [Line][9], and [Kakao][10] each have at least 100 million users, and are an existential threat to Twitter in the same way that Facebook was an existential threat to MySpace. This is a classic example of [disruption innovation][11], as described by Clayton Christensen in his book [The Innovator's Dilemma][12]. If you're unfamiliar, [watch the first ten minutes of this talk][13].

Twitter has had a barebones messaging feature since it launched in 2006, but for years Direct Messages have been hidden in their apps and website. Twitter ignored messaging because it was a commodity feature that was not central to their core broadcasting product and had been historically difficult to monetize. As Christensen might predict, Twitter seemed happy to let those other companies relieve them of the least valuable part of their product, so that they could better focus on what was important to the business.

Meanwhile, the aforementioned messaging apps grew like very innovative weeds. Snapchat pioneered [ephemeral social media][17], Line showed that sales of virtual [stickers could generate substantial revenue][18] (and everyone else followed suit), and WhatsApp has shown that people *would actually pay money* for social apps ([$0.99/year][19] adds up over [400 million users][20]). More problematically for Twitter, these apps are branching out into other aspects of social networking: Snapchat recently launched [a broadcast-status-like feature called Stories][21], Kik is pushing [a platform that enables third-parties to develop social apps][22], and WeChat offers [a Tweet-like Moments feature][23]. These apps were all beginning to move upmarket into Twitter's profitable broadcasting territory.

Twitter, to its credit, has tried to move its product back downmarket. They [recently resurrected DMs][14] with support for photos and a more prominent placement, but they're [still bizarrely tied to Twitter's follow graph][15] -- my friends might still want me to be able to talk to them even if they don't want to be bothered by all of my public tweets -- despite [experiments with fewer restrictions][16]. You can't teach an old feature new tricks...

... which leaves Twitter with a troubling dilemma: how do they defend their current successful product?

Conversation is important defense

indifferent to the quality of interpersonal communication on its platform

Threading - there's nothing wrong with nesting

subscribe to conversations

##### Leverage Twitter's Unique Social Graph

other apps only have address book, twitter has interest graph.
interesting feature of dashdash[link to post]

twitter's currently-unique advantage is that it a network for interacting with people you don't already know, unlike google and Facebook and etcetc

##### Keep it Simple

Sometimes I go to Twitter because I want to know what;'s happening. Sometimes I go to Twitter because I want to talk to people. These are very distinct experiences, and they need not occur in the same app.

Don't overcomplicate the current product, but instead build a separate one.
 
Twitter-as-a-service is more valuable because it does both things, but Twitter-as-a-product is harder to use because the functionality is intermingled, like vines strangling each other (pun intended). But Vine-the-service-and-the-product suggests a solution.

##### Degrade Gracefully

backwards compatibility with both @-replies and DMs

users that opt in receive DMs in messaging app, not as DMs

The points of interface with the product are (and always have been) too simple

Twitter is a town square, but all we can do is yell and whisper.
