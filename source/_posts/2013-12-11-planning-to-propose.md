Elizabeth and I first talked about marriage almost two years ago, while [admiring the Manhattan skyline][1] at a wedding afterparty. As our relationship got more serious, our conversations slowly transitioned from discussions of what we each wanted to discussions of what we both wanted. Eventually we were making plans to visit wedding venues, thinking about possible dates, and sharing Google Docs with guest lists... but we were not yet engaged.

I wanted to propose, and Elizabeth wanted me to propose. Even though the question itself was expected, I still wanted to surprise her with the where and the when. This was also something I was only going to get to do once, so I wanted the moment to be personally meaningful, intimate, and romantic. We had plans for the third anniversary of our first date in mid-December, but that was the obvious time to pop the question. What could I do instead? I'll tell the story from her perspective, and add my thoughts and behind-the-scenes commentary as blockquotes.

![](/images/2013/12/proposal1.jpg)

Last year for Thanksgiving Elizabeth spent the holiday with me and my family, so this year I wanted to return the favor. When I bought my plane tickets we considered coordinating our flights, but she wanted to be at home for longer than I wanted to be away from work, so I ended up flying out later, on Wednesday, November 27th, and leaving earlier, on Monday, December 2nd. Elizabeth was leaving Seattle on Wednesday, December 3rd for San Francisco, and the next day had the first in a series of three interviews in three different cities.

> So Tuesday, December 2nd was the day that I was planning to propose.
> 
> In an earlier version of the plan, before she had those interviews scheduled, I was going to surprise her at the Seattle-Tacoma airport before her flight home from there to NYC. I'd book us both tickets on a flight later the same evening, and make a reservation at [a fancy restaurant][2] near the airport to celebrate.
> 
> While airports are perhaps not the most romantic of places, SEA has special meaning for us. First, Elizabeth received the initial OkCupid message from me when she was at the airport. Second, when I went to visit Elizabeth in Seattle in the August of 2011, we both thought our return flight was three hours later than it actually was. We realized this mostly-too-late, but still rushed to the airport. They were closing the boarding doors just as we were arriving at the gate, but had given away one of our two seats to a standby passenger. We would have made it, but Elizabeth's stethoscope held her up in the security line.  Rather than split up, we decided to stay togehter at the airport. We got to have another lunch with her brother, and then spent a long day at the airport, and had an arduous four-flight trip back to NYC... but we were in good company, so wasn't so bad, and the mild adversity brought us closer together.

While I was boarding my flight from JFK to SEA, I texted Elizabeth and told her that I had needed to check my carry-on at the gate, so I might need a few extra minutes when I arrived.

> If I was going to surprise her, then it seemed even better to surprise her wearing a suit. So I packed a garment bag and some wire hangers along with my suit, tie, pocket squares, belt, socks, and dress shoes in my carry-on. It would have been difficult/risky to take the suit to Elizabeth's house – if she had seen it, how would I explain having brough it? – so instead I left it at luggage storage at the airport. I wasn't checking a bag, and the suit and shoes are bulky, so this required underpacking for the rest of the trip, which in turn meant I had to do laundry and claim I miscounted the number of boxers/socks I'd need for the trip.  I knew I'd need some extra time to extract these things from my bag, transfer them to the garment bag, and find the luggage storage desk, so I made up the story about gate-checking to buy the time.
>
> While unpacking and repacking for our weekend trip to Port Townsend that weekend, Elizabeth had a few occasions to see what I had brought with me, so while I could have hidden my suit in the corner of a closet in her house, it would have been risky. Maybe I could have dispensed with suit entirely, but I think it added a lot to the surprise, and she appreciated that my tie matched her sapphire.

My flight went without incident, and on the drive from her house to the airport she commented about the weather forecast, which was predicting snow on the evening of my departure a few days later – perhaps I'd get stuck, and have to stay longer after all.

> This was exactly what I was planning to do! I had booked [a hotel near the airport][3] for the Monday night I was supposedly taking a redeye, and was planning to stay there, propose on Tuesday, and fly with her to SFO the next day.

She also asked how I had spent the first part of my day, and I mumbled something about email and reading.
 
> This was because I had spent the morning and early afternoon running frantically around the island looking at engagement rings, and hadn't thought of a plausible alibi. I had done a ton of research online beforehand, so I planned out a route and tried to see as many rings as I could before my flight. I knew she wanted a sapphire, but after going to several shops, I decided that what I really wanted to do was pick out a gemstone and a setting with her rather than try to find something that I liked that I also was confident she would like. I ended up getting an inexpensive ring with which I could propose if I felt like I needed it, with the intent that we'd pick a nicer ring out together later and keep the other for sentimental reasons.

Elizabeth, her mother Angela, her brother Andrew, and I were going to Port Townsend for two nights the Friday after Thanksgiving. Elizabeth's father passed away several years ago, but I still wanted to ask her mother for her hand in marriage, and Elizabeth agreed that she would appreciate the gesture. I was hoping for a quiet moment alone with Angela before we left for Port Townsend, but there were no good opportunities, so I asked Elizabeth if she could draw away her brother for a few minutes while exploring on Saturday. Later that afternoon Elizabeth and her brother went to park the car, I had my chance, and Angela said that I could marry her daughter.

> Yay! In retrospect, this went much more smoothly than it could have, but I was too busy worrying about the proposal plan to psych myself out.
> 
> This is when I first told Angela about my secret alternate travel plans, and she was happy to help get Elizabeth to a particular time and place on Tuesday, since she was taking the day off from work anyway. We agreed to both brainstorm a bit and figure out the details later. I had originally been reluctant to tell Angela or Andrew about the details of the plan, since I know that *I* was acting weirdly, and I felt like the more people that knew, the more likely it was that Elizabeth would grow suspicious. But in retrospect, I needn't have worried.
> 
> Over the next couple of days Angela and I had a few secret conversations about where a good place would be to propose. We talked about the ice rink in Tacoma, the [Chihuly Bridge of Glass][4], the ferris wheel in Seattle, and the Space Needle, but I kept coming back to the Seattle Central Library. There was something about my favorite place in her favorite place -- the building within her home city/state -- that just felt *right*.
> 
> I had already known that Angela was planning to take the day off on Tuesday. Earlier that week I had offered to give Elizabeth a massage that day at the spa at the [Alexis Hotel][5] before her gauntlet of interviews later that week. The story I gave was that my mom had a gift card from when my family had stayed there on vacation the summer before, which was why it had to be that particular hotel spa rather than somewhere closer to her home in Tacoma. I had planned to call Elizabeth immediately after the massage and ask her to pick something up at the library a few blocks away – perhaps a photocopy that could only be obtained from Special Collections, or a(n imaginary) limited edition Moleskine notebook imprinted with the building facade (as these [Evernote Moleskines][6] are imprinted).
> 
> Unfortunately I had to scrap that whole plan because Elizabeth told me her mom was planning to take the day off of work to spend with her, and I wasn't sure I could get Elizabeth alone for the proposal itself. I was a bit awkward in dodging her counter-suggestion that we go for massages together the day before while I was still there (which would have ruined the surprise!), but I don't think she suspected much. At least I learned her mother wsa taking Tuesday off, and could create new plans accordingly.

We travelled back to Elizabeth's home outside of Tacoma on Sunday, and on Monday Elizabeth and I had the day to ourselves. She showed me some things I hadn't seen before in Tacoma (the [Five Mile Drive][7] is beautiful!), and had [a nice lunch][8]. We talked a bit about engagement rings, and I said that I had done some research and showed her my Pinterest board. She also was happy with the idea of picking something out together, and after lunch we drove up to Seattle.

> It was a little weird to be having this conversation while I had the ring in my pocket! Elizabeth said later that she knew that when I proposed she wasn't going to see it coming, so was no longer taking such conversations as actual indications of my lack of preparedness.

One of my favorite buildings is the city, [REX][9]/[OMA][10]'s [Seattle Central Library][11] (it even has [a TED talk][12]). We had explored the building together on my first trip to visit Elizabeth in Washington two years before, so I told Elizabeth that I'd like to visit it again on our way to dinner.

{% iframe_embed instagram hcMLaIA2wp 340x438 %}

After a little difficulty navigating through Seattle and finding parking, we enjoyed wandering through a building flooded with light from the setting Sun. When we went back outside into the cold I said I wanted to make a quick phone call to a friend I had been trying to connect with, and asked if I could go back inside the library where it was warm. Elizabeth found a computer to use while I made the call, and I was done a few minutes later, at which point we continued on down to the ferris wheel and [one of our favorite bars][13]. We went from there to [dinner][14], and then Elizabeth drove me to the airport for my redeye back to New York, where we said goodbye.

> I actually called Angela, and we talked about more details for Tuesday. The reason I needed to go back inside to make the call will become clear in a moment, but I was not at all smooth about doing it, and nearly ruined the whole plan. Fortunately I don't think Elizabeth noticed nor suspected anything.
> 
> On our way to the ferris wheel we passed the aforementioned Alexis Hotel. I don't think Elizabeth noticed we were passing it, but I was nervous that she would ask about the previously offerred massage there and become suspicious.

A couple hours later, I called Elizabeth in a panic – I didn't have [my notebook][15]! I told her that I last saw it at the library, when I took it out to jot something down while I had been on the phone, and that I would call them in the morning to see if they had it.

> After Elizabeth drove away from the airport, I pretended to check in and walk toward security, and then called her mother again to finalize more of the details for the next day. After that I left the airport, walked to the aforementioned nearby hotel, and checked in. I then called her from the hotel lobby, hoping that the background noise would sound similar to that in an ariport. I actually cut the timing pretty close, and nearly waited to call until after my flight was supposed to take off, but it was fine. Of course I still had my notebook safely in my luggage – I had considered *actually* leaving it at the library, but it seemed too risky given how uncertain everything was.

I asked her if she and her mom were heading up to Seattle anyway and it was in fact at the library, then could she could pick it up for me? Elizabeth said her mom hadn't been that enthusiastic about going up to the city, and I said I'd get back to her after the library opened at 10am the next morning and I had confirmed it was even there.

> Angela played the part wonderfully and changed her mind about the trip to Seattle at the last minute, right after I had called about the missing notebook, saying "Oh, let's just go!"

The next morning I texted her to say that the library did have the notebook, but that it wasn't at the regular Lost & Found, but rather at the Special Collections desk in the Seattle Room on the tenth floor. Elizabeth said that she and her mother were in fact coming to the city, and they would stop by to pick up the notebook.

> By this point, I was already back at the library! I had woken up early, put on my suit, and taken an Uber back to Seattle, so it was a sigh of relief to hear that they were, in fact, coming to the city. If Elizabeth hadn't been up for it, I would have had to get myself to Tacoma and find some other way to surprise her -- my worst case backup plan was to wait until she left the house to take their dog Jack for a walk... but it was cold outside, and would have been hard to wait.
> 
> The regular Lost & Found is at the security desk on the ground floor. It's busy and not especially pretty down there, and I was worried that the security guards were not going to cooperate, hence the story about the desk on the tenth floor. When the Seattle Room opened at 11am I told the librarian there an (abbreviated!) version of the plan and asked if I could leave my notebook there. She was not as enthusiastic about the plan as I had hoped, and she said that her shift ended at noon, so I might need to talk to someone else depending on at what time Elizabeth arrived, and she didn't want to accept the notebook in the interim. I found a chair nearby, and waited. While waiting, I put the ring inside the notebook in the cutout with the pen. To ensure that Elizabeth opened the notebook, I texted her to ask if she could make sure an important receipt was still in the back pocket.
> 
> I had considered hiring a photographer to surreptitiously document everything, but it seemed too complicated and invasive, especially since the plan didnt come together until the last minute. In retrospect I could have taken more photos myself, or even set my iPhone down somewhere to record video, but I appreciated the time for quiet reflection as I waited for Elizabeth to arrive, and sometimes memories are best left to themselves.

Elizabeth and Angela arrived at the library an hour or two later, and Angela waited in the car while Elizabeth ran upstairs. The elevator to get to the tenth floor took a couple minutes, but because she had been there the day before she knew right where to go.

> Angela called me after Elizabeth got out of the car. I didn't answer because I knew it meant Elizabeth was on her way up. I went back to the same librarian, who didn't want to accept the notebook but said that I could leave it on the desk. When Elizabeth stepped out of the elevators on the tenth floor, the Seattle Room would be on her right, so I ducked around a corner to the left towards the atrium outlook (pictured below left). While the elevators themselves have solid walls, the elevator bank has a glass wall, so I could see when the elevators were going to arrive. Soon enough, one did, and I waited a few seconds before peeking around the corner. There was Elizabeth, walking the other way towards the Seattle Room, so I ducked back around the corner and waited a few more seconds...

She retrieved the notebook from the Seattle Room, and opened it to look inside on her way back to the elevator. For a moment she looked puzzled by the ring, and when she looked up, I had just appeared from around the corner. We embraced, and I got down on one knee. I asked her to marry me, and she said yes!

Fortunately there was no one else around at that particular moment, so it was perfectly romantic and private. A couple minutes later another librarian offered to take some photos of us with my phone, and then we went outside and met Angela in the car. We went from there to a delicious lunch at [the rotating restaurant in the Seattle Space Needle][16], making phone calls to family along the way.

![](/images/2013/12/proposal3.jpg)

After that we did some shopping in Seattle, went to my hotel near the airport to pick up my bag, and then drove back to Elizabeth's house outside of Tacoma. Angela dropped Elizabeth and I off for [a quiet celebratory dinner in Tacoma][17], and we also got to say hello to her grandparents.

Any number of things could have foiled the plan and left us with a less perfect proposal story. We were lucky the whole thing went smoothly, but that's negligible in comparison to how lucky we were to find each other in the first place <3
