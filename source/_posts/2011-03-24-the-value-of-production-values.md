excerpt: What we can all learn from Rebecca Black.
---
For those of you that haven’t looked at the Internet in the past week or so, there’s a 13-year-old named Rebecca Black who made a music video called "[Friday][1]." It hockey-sticked to over 40 million views on YouTube and has earned her [an awful lot of criticism][2], as well as [an awful lot of money][3].

If a piece has high production values -- whether its a video shot with proper lighting or a website designed with an effective grid and color scheme -- people will pay attention. They may mock you for a mismatch between the quality of your content and the quality of your production -- would anyone care about "Friday" if it had been shot and edited with an iPhone 4? -- but they will pay attention. In our [information-overloaded, failed-filter][4] future, attention is the most valuable commodity, and [hacking the attention economy][5] with a polished piece of content is a useful and lucrative thing to be able to do.
