If you tried to visit my site in the next few hours, it probably wasn't loading. DreamHost, the company doing my web hosting, had a [problem][1] at one of their data centers. You can see the block below when it was down (where I'm getting no visitors), from [Google Analytics][2] --

On the day after I got two or three times as many site views as I had on any previous day, this is pretty inconvenient, and I'm probably going to switch hosts. Al3x [recommended][3] [Gandi][4], and I'll look more into it in the next couple of days.

(I really wish Google or Amazon offered the sort of hosting service I needed.. those are the only companies I would really trust.)

I apologize to everyone for the inconvenience. Hopefully it doesn't happen again.
