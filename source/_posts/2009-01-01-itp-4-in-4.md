excerpt: "Four projects in four days!"
---
I've been co-coordinating a 4-in-4 at ITP with [Rob][1] and [Caroline][2], in which participants will complete four projects in four days. It will take place during this current Winter Break from January 12-15, and it looks like we're going to have at least 20 student participants. (By our definition, projects are real, have a name, and are documented.)

We've set up a [Google Group][3] and there's a page in [ITPedia][4] with the signup list. Also, be sure to check out the pages for past iterations of the idea -- June 2008's [7 in Seven][5] and July 2008's [5-in-5][6].

Our [4-in-4.com][7] and/or [itp.nyu.edu/4-in-4][8] will go up in the next week or so -- be sure to check back!
