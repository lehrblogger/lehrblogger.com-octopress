During the 2004-2005 academic year I participated in the [Stanford Film Society][1]&#8216;s Student Filmmaker&#8217;s Workshop. Over the course of the year we learned how to use the SFS equipment and Final Cut Pro to produce a series of three short films as assignments and one longer final film to be shown in the annual Student Film Festival.
