A couple weeks ago I presented Wanderli.st during Thesis Week at NYU's Interactive Telecommunications Program. The list of all of the presentations is [here][1], and ITP has a copy of the video hosted [here][2], but I've also embedded it below. Some of the slides are difficult to read in the video, so they are embedded as well. If you're in a hurry and think you can read faster than I was talking (hah!), the notes on which the talk was based are below each slide.

I've been thinking a lot the best way to continue this work now that I am free from academia, and about how Wanderli.st fits with other proposals such as [Diaspora][3] (which has gotten [incredible support][4]). I'll continue to publish updates here, and let me know if you have any ideas you'd like to discuss!

*Note: I had originally wanted to synchronize the PDF of the slides with the video, but I couldn't find a good tool to help me with this -- [Omnisio][5] has disabled the ability to create new presentations since they were acquired by Google, and the [Zentation][6] player was simply [too ugly][7] (despite their much prettier main website). Let me know if you can recommend something!*
