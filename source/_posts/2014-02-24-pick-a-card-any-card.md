  Solving the paradox of choice



[^1]: Tinder is not the first app to ask the user to rate a succession of items. The first example I can think of is [the Hot or Not of a decade ago](https://web.archive.org/web/20040225003702/http://hotornot.com/), and Pandora also offers a thumbs-up or thumbs-down interface for giving feedback on songs. These are slightly different, but Tinder is the first app I know of to use a card-based interface. Other apps have used a similar interface post-Tinder for other types of content, such as [Branch's link-sharing service Potluck](http://techcrunch.com/2013/11/21/link-sharing-service-potlucks-new-app-combining-messaging-and-news-including-original-content/), but it was focused around content consumption rather than decision making.

[^2]: [Paul Adams recently wrote](http://insideintercom.io/why-cards-are-the-future-of-the-web/) about the trend towards cards as general interactive containers for all types of content, and a startup called [Wildcard](http://www.trywildcard.com) wants to replace the Internet on the phone with a library of cards designed for mobile. While these are compelling visions for the future, they are outside of the scopeof this post; cards can greatly improve the user experience for certain types of choices regardless of their prevalence in other contexts.

[^2]: TODO: the choice of what movie to watch and what restaurant to go to both get even more complex if the user is trying to make a decision with friends about what to watch or where to go. Maybe lists are syncâ€™d between devices to help with group decision making, we each see same possibilities, compares maybe lists at the end. Wandering around a Blockbuster with friends
