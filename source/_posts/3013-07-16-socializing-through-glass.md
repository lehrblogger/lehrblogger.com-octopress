[Google Glass][1] has sparked considerable debate about privacy and the role that technology should play in our lives. This public [resistance is certainly *not* futile][2]: the success or failure of Glass depends on whether it can alleviate these concerns and/or provide so much value that people tolerate it anyway. The camera, and to a lesser extent the microphone, are perhaps the biggest issues[^1]; because the hardware is always in the same place, even when not in use, people in the vicinity of the Glass wearer won't know if they are being recorded. (Cell phones, in contrast, are held differently when the user is taking a photo, and prior cameras had lens caps.) Frog Design researcher Jan Chipchase [described the consequences of this uncertainty][3]:

>It will be interesting to see whether Glass is perceived as a threatening object and thus may force others in proximity of a wearer to maintain a hyper-awareness of the wearer and their own actions in places — whereas today, they are currently able to relax. This would be, in effect, like a blanket tax on the collective attention of society[^2].

Due to this attention tax, people will prefer that those around them *not* be wearing Glass, no matter how useful it is *to the wearer*. Many of the advertised features of Glass are utility apps, such as the clock, weather forecasts, driving directions with traffic reports, breaking news notifications, and email previews, but non-weares who prefer not to be recorded are indifferent, at best, to the wearer's convenience[^3]. **The key to the success of Glass, then, are apps that are useful not only to the wearer, but also *to other people nearby*.** If the tax on our collective attention is a negative externality, then Glass needs a positive externality to balance it. This positive externality is distinct from network effects between people who have Glass: while there will certainly be applications that cause Glass to be more useful as more people have it (as with fax machines and Facebook), the network will be unable to reach critical mass in the face of negative public opinion.

The aspect of Glass most troublesome to those nearby also has the potential to provide them with the most value: the camera. Glass is not causing the first ever furor around photography, and it's instructive to compare Glass to previously-new recording technologies. In that same essay, Chipchase paraphrases, and then later quotes, the September 18th, 1885 edition of *Amateur Photgrapher* magazine[^4]. Respectively:
> There is but one remedy for the Glass wearer – a bucket of iced water in the face whenever you suspect he has taken you unawares.  
> [...]  
> There is but one remedy for the amateur photographer. Put a brick through his camera whenever you suspect he has taken you unawares.

Chipchase also links to ['The Camera Fiend'][6], an article by Bill Jay that details the extreme distaste held for amateur photagraphs. How did society transition from one in which amateur photographers were derided for privacy violations, to one in which *everyone* is an amateur photographer with a camera in their pocket?

**Cameras are ubiquitous because people enjoy the images they produce.** If people merely enjoyed using cameras to *create* the images, that would be insufficient, due to the Glass-like negative externalities. The balancing positive externality is that people other than the photographer are able to enjoy the images after they are taken. Imagine, for a moment, a birthday party the early days of point-and-shoot cameras: everyone wants to have a friend with a camera to document the celebration, and as a result everyone wants to buy a camera and *be* that friend.

The right social applications can be a similar boon to Glass if they take advantage of the unique aspects of the Glass camera; if the applications aren't unique to Glass, then they'll be a boon to some other piece of hardware instead. Improvements in both capture technology (from Daguerreotypes, to wet plates, to dry plates, to film, to digital sensors) as well as hardware form-factor (from large-format, to medium-format, to rangefinders, to SLRs, to point-and-shoot digital cameras, to mobile phones) have made cameras faster and easier to use. Glass has a camera so small that it can rest just above the photographer's right eye, available at a moment's notice with a touch or a voice command. And like mobile phones, Glass has a data connection, so the wearer can share those photos and videos quickly and easily.

Google knows this, as was apparent in the early promo video above, yet the potential is much broader than video phonecalls and photos broadcast to social networks. [As Dustin Curtis points out][4], aplications have recently begun to use images for communication, rather than artistic expression or documentation. A single photo can carry a large amount of information, and can tell the viewer "where someone is, what time it is, who they are with, and much more." The popularity of Snapchat's ephemeral, exploding content illustrates the communicative potential of images, and the first-person perspective inherent to Glass[^4], as well as the low-friction capture process, are perfect for this use case. The friends and family of Glass wearers can enjoy this unique and personal communicative content even if they don't have Glass themselves[^5].

The opportunity for new communication tools is larger, however, than incrementally-improved versions of apps we have today. The Glass hardware is well-suited for **optionally synchronous** conversations with individuals and groups who are far away. Optionally synchronous conversations are somewhere between the synchronicity of a phone call and the asynchronicity of email, and a good example is desktop instant messaging on AIM or Gchat. This type of communication is great for communicating with friends while watching television or with co-workers whom you don't want to interrupt, and recipients can respond at their leisure with only an *expectation* of timeliness. While multitasking required by optionally synchronous interactions can be distracting, it's useful to integrate these conversations into other contexts.

Glass will allow its wearers to intergrate these conversations into many new contexts. The activities featured in the [How It Feels promo video][5] video look too engrossing for the wearers to be engaged in a fully synchronous conversation with someone somewhere else. Optionally synchronous conversations seem like the perfect way for the wearer to share these experiences with people elsewhere, while still also staying present in the moment. This would be a substantial improvement over the usage of mobile phones for similar purposes, especially because these devices tend to be used for many, many different things -- a user will look down at her phone to respond to an SMS, and get distracted by an @-reply on Twitter, a piece of breaking news, four new emails, and a spammy notification from an app she has never used.

While the above social applications allow the Glass-wearer to benefit non-wearers far away, it's also important to offset the attention tax on the people in the wearer's vicinity.

TODO, I need another image.


Even if I don't have Glass, Google needs me to want my friends to be wearing it as much as possible, even if I'm talking with them.  How can it integrate itself into our conversation? One day I imagine we'll have a searchable record of all of our IRL conversations, which seems useful for the same reasons that chat log archiving and Gmail search are useful, but only one person needs to be making the recording for both people to have access to it later. Permissioning on that information could be automatic too, since Glass should be able to recognize my voice in addition to yours, and can match it to my face or if there's any ambiguity. In addition, it could respect voice commands from either participant to make the conversation "off the record", to perform searches, etc."

> Remote Control: allow identifiable people in proximity to control Glass’s recording functionality and have access to the output of what was recorded. Allowing others to demonstrably benefit from the utility of glass will make it part of the social landscape.

conversational surplus
voice is transparent/symmetric/??? UI, more polite when others are around
other people able to use voice UI is maybe important
transcribing between contexts is a big feature. audio <-> text
voice for people nearby, myo/touch for people far away

bring others into conversation
doing things *together*  


implicit social graph?
  facebook's social graph, once it's biggest asset, will become it's biggest liability
  google's biggest mistake with G+ will be circles/copying facebook's explicit graph
  I'm sure Google has thought about, and even tried, some of this stuff.

Conclusion!
The success of Glass in the near-term[^7] hinges on whether other people want me to be wearing it, *regardless* of whether or not I have Glass myself.
externalities both for people who are in the same place as the Glass wearer, and for people elsewhere[^8].

[^1]: The prominence of the diplay is another concern -- it is both on your own face, and in the face of everyone else -- but I suspect this will be less of an issue than people think. From an industrial design perspective, Glass is remarkably elegant, and won't make the wearer look to be any more or less of a nerd. Furthermore, people are *very* adept at knowing where other people are looking, and I suspect that a glance up-and-to-the-right at the Glass display will be just as obvious, and just as rude, as a Glance down at the iPhone. Even more conspicuously, Glass wearers will need to touch or speak to the device to use it, which will be blatantly obvious if done in the middle of a conversation

[^2]: It's worth noting that other emerging technologies will levy this same tax, and that there's an upper limit to how much attention is required in total. Security cameras, [autonomous food delivery drones](http://tacocopter.com/), and even [gaming consoles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_One#Privacy_concerns) will all have increasingly networked cameras, so perhaps we'll just assume everything is always being recorded. While this future certainly seems bleak, at least Glass wouldn't have an additional adverse effect.

[^3]: I'm also skeptical that these [Google Now](http://www.google.com/landing/now/) features are solving a problem that a large number of people have. Real-time information looks cool in demos, but, personally, my schedule/habits are usually very consistent, and I can navigate my city and manage my schedule without really thinking about it. Also, airports aren't *that* complicated, and having my gate number on my ticket is convenient enough. I could be wrong about this, however, and it's unimportant to my argument.

[^4]: Given the popularity of the selfie, how long will it be until there is a press conference announcing Google Hand Mirror?

[^5]: I have an idea for app along these lines that I'm hoping to build with the Mirror API, rather than the undocumented and unsupported "sideloading" Android API. I'll post more details when I have something working!

[^7]: There are many questions about the long-term consequences of Glass:<ul><li>Will every surface be [covered in digital advertising](https://vimeo.com/8569187)? Maybe, if we're paid a lot for viewing them. People will only have so much money to spend on the advertised goods, however, so the economics seem unlikely to work out.</li><li>Will Google require the collection of ambient personal data against our wishes, and then make it accessible to those we'd rather not have it? Mark Hursts's post on this topic [raises interesting questions](http://creativegood.com/blog/the-google-glass-feature-no-one-is-talking-about/).</li><li>Will Google engineers [control our thoughts](https://vimeo.com/46304267)? I guess maybe, but this seems *way* too far away to worry about, and I'm sure there would be safeguards against Glassholes like the one in the film.</li></ul>These things are worth talking about in depth, but felt outside of the scope of this post. Perhaps this version of Google Glass will fail, but technology will keep advancing and others will keep trying until we face the answers to these questions.

[^8]: I've been [invited to the Glass Explorer program](https://twitter.com/googleglass/status/316970853969584128), and I'm scheduled to pick up my device tomorrow. My three #ifihadglass applications are [here](https://twitter.com/lehrblogger/status/306132195498676226), [here](https://twitter.com/lehrblogger/status/306907092176994304), and [here](https://twitter.com/lehrblogger/status/306926304899502080). I've thought a lot about whether the $1500+tax price tag is worth it, but I stand behind what I've written above. Glass represents a future of opportunity worth exploring, and I'm excited. [As @amybijamy said on Twitter](https://twitter.com/amybijamy/status/316986164932390912), "It's like getting into Hogwarts!"
