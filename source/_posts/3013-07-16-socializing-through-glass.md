Socializing through Glass
A Wearable Social Network

#OUTLINE

1) Glass most important as communication tool
  Google Now stuff doesn't matter
  camera, history of point and shoot (quote about brick?)
  'vision sharing' is perhaps as big of a leap as the point-and-shoot camera
  
2) Complex social issues can be solved with positive externalities

  Chipchase re negative externalities (quote about ice water?)
  collective tax on attention, but it has an upper limit when you assume you're being recorded, and there are also collective benefits
  positive externalities - The success of Glass hinges on whether other people want me to be wearing it, *regardless* of whether or not I have Glass myself.
  
  Why did the 35mm camera work? Everyone likes pictures, so everyone wants a friend who has a camera. social conventions don't just evolve magically or inevitably (look at bluetooth headsets (larry david video?)) on their own, they evolve for reasons.
  
  network effects
  externaliteis for people in same place, and more powerful externalities for people elsehwere (since there are more of them)

  success of glass is apps that make you WANT me to be wearing it - you as both my friend, and as a stranger on the street
  mutual consent for accessing recorded events
  photos identifying suspects as positive externality to offset tax
  
  conversational surplus
  voice is transparent/symmetric/??? UI, more polite when others are around
  other people able to use voice UI is maybe important
  transcribing between contexts is a big feature. audio <-> text
  voice for people nearby, myo/touch for people far away

3) Given these capabilities and social strategic constraints, what does a social network look like for Glass? in the near futrue, not totally restricted to the crurent APIs and hardware (footnote to vague plans for mirror-based dashdash app, distinction from sideloaded apps)
  doing things *together*
  
  communication tools that allows for synchronocity
  
    {% iframe_embed youtube 9c6W4CCU9M4 ?start=111 %}
  
    Glass is optionally synchronous, the video call in the promo video is cool, but more of the same. if he was playing an instrument that only needed one hand, he could have just used his smartphone.
    optionally synchronous like IM
    great for communicating while doing other things
    technically this is multitasking, but context switching or context integration?
    there's a reason we IM people who are sitting next to us, we dont want to interrupt
    
  implicit social graph
    facebook's social graph, once it's biggest asset, will become it's biggest liability
    google's biggest mistake with G+ will be circles/copying facebook's explicit graph
    I'm sure Google has thought about, and even tried, some of this stuff.
  
  glass is a devices without inboxes for other apps
  
  high-information-density photos and videos are now being used as communication rather than documentation (especially on Snapchat).

 * Design for Glass
 * Don't get in the way
 * Keep it timely
 * Avoid the unexpected

The key to making Glass successful is to focus on the positive externalities and network effects. Even if I don't have Glass, Google needs me to want my friends to be wearing it as much as possible, even if I'm talking with them. That's how network effects work – it's easy to think abstractly that SMS, fax machines, and Facebook become more valuable as more people use them, but there's also a very concrete desire that I had/have for my friends to be able to send/receive SMS messages, for companies that I do business with to send/receive faxes (since the alternative was, uh, the USPS), and for everyone I meet to have Facebook. The individuals that make up these network grow the networks through peer pressure, but the social complexities and power asymmetries of Glass require that the pressure come from both inside and outside the network.

As I tweeted to Jenna, vision sharing and frictionless photography is a big deal. Snapchat was revolutionary because it repurposed photography for use as a communication medium, rather than a documentation medium, by making the content only viewable once. Glass is going to drastically decrease the barriers to capturing photos/videos, so I think sharing Snapchat-style "exploding" content on Glass is going to eventually be as mainstream as leaving a voicemail. I'll want my friends to have glass because I'll want to receive those photos/videos, even if I have to take my phone out of my pocket to consume or reciprocate.

If you have glass, and I don't, how can it be useful to me for you to be wearing it while we talk over beers? How can it integrate itself into our conversation? One day I imagine we'll have a searchable record of all of our IRL conversations, which seems useful for the same reasons that chat log archiving and Gmail search are useful, but only one person needs to be making the recording for both people to have access to it later. Permissioning on that information could be automatic too, since Glass should be able to recognize my voice in addition to yours, and can match it to my face or if there's any ambiguity. In addition, it could respect voice commands from either participant to make the conversation "off the record", to perform searches, etc."

> * Proximate Transparency: allow anyone in proximity to access the same feed that the wearer is recording or seeing and e.g. view it through a device of their choosing. Make it easy to identify the Glasses themselves and to trace back to the wearer. This simple act help demystify the technology, create a broader sense ownership of its inclusion in any given space. The reality is very few people would be interested in jacking in and the act of having an open stream will change the behaviour of what is watched. For many this won’t be enough of a step, it is after all an opt-out measure for people who have the technological nous and literacy – forcing people in proximity to do something for dubious gain.
> * Remote Control: allow identifiable people in proximity to control Glass’s recording functionality and have access to the output of what was recorded. Allowing others to demonstrably benefit from the utility of glass will make it part of the social landscape.

Possible Footnotes:
[^0]: screen is not yet in front of eyes, friends will know if you're distracted. i really don't think this is going to be an issue. it'll be obviously rude to use the device whenever someone breaks eye contact, especialyl since oyu have to touch or speak to it.
  
[^0]: long term stuff: 
    could a camera on glass read your own facial expressions?
    strange days movie: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yaXPx6xWEQ
    that sight video, https://vimeo.com/46304267, is too far away, and also only *really* problematic because the guy was a douchebag *and* the technology was super far away. 
    
[^0]: ads everywhere: https://vimeo.com/8569187 no one is going to consent to this unless we're getting paid TONS of money for our attention. the economics seem unlikely to work out

[^0]: if i had glass applications:

  https://twitter.com/amybijamy/status/316986164932390912, it's like getting into Hogwarts

[^0]: Myo
  haptic feedback: vibrations, implanted magnets
  communication devices that lead us like a dance partner
  maybe we tend to underemphasize the communicativity of touch
  smell and taste dont matter since we can't really produce those stimuli in other people (pheremones are subconscious)

[^0]: maybe glass will fail, but much of this will probably apply to the second attempt

  In long run doesn't matter whether Google Glass v1 is success or failure. Wearable, context aware, augmented reality is our future.
