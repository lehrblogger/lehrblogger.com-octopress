Socializing through Glass
A Wearable Social Network
Through the Looking Glass

"wearing is sharing"
"sharing is wearing"
"wearing is sharing is caring"

 * Design for Glass
 * Don't get in the way
 * Keep it timely
 * Avoid the unexpected

collective tax on attention, but it has an upper limit when you assume you're being recorded, and there are also collective benefits

success of glass is apps that make you WANT me to be wearing it - you as both my friend, and as a stranger on the street
mutual consent for accessing recorded events
photos identifying suspects as positive externality to offset tax

screen is not yet in front of eyes, friends will know if you're distracted.

Myo
  haptic feedback: vibrations, implanted magnets
  communication devices that lead us like a dance partner
  maybe we tend to underemphasize the communicativity of touch
  smell and taste dont matter since we can't really produce those stimuli in other people (pheremones are subconscious)

conversational surplus
voice is transparent/symmetric/??? UI, more polite when others are around
other people able to use voice UI is maybe important
transcribing between contexts is a big feature. audio <-> text
voice for people nearby, myo/touch for people far away

high-information-density photos and videos are now being used as communication rather than documentation (especially on Snapchat).

#ifihadglass I'd build new ways for us to share synchronous experiences as if we were *with* far-away friends/family. http://t.co/xqc6okvwif

In long run doesn't matter whether Google Glass v1 is success or failure. Wearable, context aware, augmented reality is our future.

I'm much more excited about Glass as a communication device than any of the other Google-Now-related use cases.

#ifihadglass I'd automatically augment my social graph with always-on face/voice recognition, so I could spend less time managing it myself.

#ifihadglass I'd build info sharing tools for enriching IRL conversations. If I search for something, the friends with me should see result.

Would like to hug man who just said he was sick of ways to social network & asked "What can I do with Glass that I can't with my cellphone?"

@jennydeluxe I'm most excited for Glass as a communication tool, 'vision sharing' is perhaps as big of a leap as the point-and-shoot camera.

@lehrblogger but they only showed that as it relates to Google+ and other social share tools. will be interesting to see what else emerges.

The key to making Glass successful is to focus on the positive externalities and network effects. Even if I don't have Glass, Google needs me to want my friends to be wearing it as much as possible, even if I'm talking with them. That's how network effects work – it's easy to think abstractly that SMS, fax machines, and Facebook become more valuable as more people use them, but there's also a very concrete desire that I had/have for my friends to be able to send/receive SMS messages, for companies that I do business with to send/receive faxes (since the alternative was, uh, the USPS), and for everyone I meet to have Facebook. The individuals that make up these network grow the networks through peer pressure, but the social complexities and power asymmetries of Glass require that the pressure come from both inside and outside the network.

The way to do that is to focus on Glass as a social communication device. A couple ideas:

As I tweeted to Jenna, vision sharing and frictionless photography is a big deal. Snapchat was revolutionary because it repurposed photography for use as a communication medium, rather than a documentation medium, by making the content only viewable once. Glass is going to drastically decrease the barriers to capturing photos/videos, so I think sharing Snapchat-style "exploding" content on Glass is going to eventually be as mainstream as leaving a voicemail. I'll want my friends to have glass because I'll want to receive those photos/videos, even if I have to take my phone out of my pocket to consume or reciprocate.

If you have glass, and I don't, how can it be useful to me for you to be wearing it while we talk over beers? How can it integrate itself into our conversation? One day I imagine we'll have a searchable record of all of our IRL conversations, which seems useful for the same reasons that chat log archiving and Gmail search are useful, but only one person needs to be making the recording for both people to have access to it later. Permissioning on that information could be automatic too, since Glass should be able to recognize my voice in addition to yours, and can match it to my face or if there's any ambiguity. In addition, it could respect voice commands from either participant to make the conversation "off the record", to perform searches, etc."

what a social network native to google glass might look like

both with current APIs/hardware, and in the near futrue

first a communication tool

#UnrealizedDystopias
 * New technlogies spark overblown fears of the future
 * credit cards will let banks can track our every purchase
 * GPS in our phones will track everywhere we go

could a camera on glass read your own facial expressions?

glass is a devices without inboxes for other apps

doing things *together*

> * Proximate Transparency: allow anyone in proximity to access the same feed that the wearer is recording or seeing and e.g. view it through a device of their choosing. Make it easy to identify the Glasses themselves and to trace back to the wearer. This simple act help demystify the technology, create a broader sense ownership of its inclusion in any given space. The reality is very few people would be interested in jacking in and the act of having an open stream will change the behaviour of what is watched. For many this won’t be enough of a step, it is after all an opt-out measure for people who have the technological nous and literacy – forcing people in proximity to do something for dubious gain.
> * Remote Control: allow identifiable people in proximity to control Glass’s recording functionality and have access to the output of what was recorded. Allowing others to demonstrably benefit from the utility of glass will make it part of the social landscape.


Glass is optionally synchronous, the video call in the promo video is cool, but more of the same. if he was playing an instrument that only needed one hand, he could have just used his smartphone.
optionally synchronous like IM
great for communicating while doing other things
technically this is multitasking, but context switching or context integration?
there's a reason we IM people who are sitting next to us, we dont want to interrupt

implicit social graph
facebook's social graph, once it's biggest asset, will become it's biggest liability
google's biggest mistake with G+ will be circles/copying facebook's explicit graph
