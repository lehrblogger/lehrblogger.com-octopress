[Google Glass][1] has sparked considerable debate about privacy and the role that technology should play in our lives. This public [resistance is certainly *not* futile][2]: the success or failure of Glass depends on whether it can alleviate these concerns and/or provide so much value that people tolerate it anyway. The camera, and to a lesser extent the microphone, are perhaps the biggest issue[^1]; because the hardware is always in the same place, even when not in use, people in the vicinity of the Glass wearer won't know if they are being recorded. (Cell phones, in contrast, are held differently when the user is taking a photo, and prior cameras had lens caps.) Frog Design researcher Jan Chipchase [described the consequences of this uncertainty][3]:

>It will be interesting to see whether Glass is perceived as a threatening object and thus may force others in proximity of a wearer to maintain a hyper-awareness of the wearer and their own actions in places — whereas today, they are currently able to relax. This would be, in effect, like a blanket tax on the collective attention of society[^2].

Due to this attention tax, people will prefer that those around them *not* be wearing Glass, no matter how useful it is *to the wearer*.  Many of the advertised features of Glass are utility apps, such as the clock, weather forecasts, driving directions with traffic reports, breaking news notifications, and email previews. While these [Google-Now-type features][4] are somewhat useful[^3], they simplify these tasks [only by a difference in degree, rather than by a difference in kind][5]; our current mobile devices are 'good enough.'

The key to the success of Glass, then, are apps that are useful not only to the wearer, but also *to other people nearby*. If the tax on our collective attention is a negative externality, then Glass needs a positive externality to balance it. This positive externality is distinct from network effects between people who have Glass: while there will certainly be applications that cause Glass to be more useful as more people have it (as with fax machines and Facebook), the network will be unable to reach critical mass in the face of negative public opinion.

Interestingly, the aspect of Glass most troublesome to those nearby also has the potential to provide them with the most value: the camera. This is not the first time photography has created a furor, and it's instructive to compare Glass to previously new technologies. In that same essay, Chipchase paraphrases, and then later quotes, the September 18th, 1885 edition of *Amateur Photgrapher* magazine[^4]. Respectively:
> There is but one remedy for the Glass wearer – a bucket of iced water in the face whenever you suspect he has taken you unawares.  
> [...]  
> There is but one remedy for the amateur photographer. Put a brick through his camera whenever you suspect he has taken you unawares.

Chipchase also links to ['The Camera Fiend'][6], an article by Bill Jay that details the extreme distaste held for amateur photagraphs. How did society transition from one in which amateur photographers were derided for privacy violations, to one in which *everyone* is an amateur photographer with a camera in their pocket?

**Cameras are ubiquitous because people enjoy the images they produce.** If people merely enjoyed *creating* the images, that would be insufficient, due to negative externalities inherent to cameras that are similar to those inherent to Glass. The balancing positive externality is that people other than the photographer are able to enjoy the images after they are taken. Imagine, for a moment, a birthday party the early days of point-and-shoot cameras -- everyone wants to have a friend with a camera to document the celebration, and as a result everyone wants to buy a camera and *be* that friend.



The right set of social applications can be a similar boon to Glass, but we already have point-and-shoot cameras, so 


In comparison to cell phone cameras, the Glass camera is such a significant simplification of the picture-taking process that it *does* constitute a difference in kind.



1) Glass most important as communication tool
  camera, history of point and shoot
  {% iframe_embed youtube 9c6W4CCU9M4 ?start=111 %}
  'vision sharing' is perhaps as big of a leap as the point-and-shoot camera
  hands free
  
  The success of Glass hinges on whether other people want me to be wearing it, *regardless* of whether or not I have Glass myself.
  
  Why did the 35mm camera work? Everyone likes pictures, so everyone wants a friend who has a camera. social conventions don't just evolve magically or inevitably (look at bluetooth headsets (larry david video?)) on their own, they evolve for reasons.
  
  externalities for people in same place, and more powerful externalities for people elsehwere (since there are more of them)

  success of glass is apps that make you WANT me to be wearing it - you as both my friend, and as a stranger on the street
  mutual consent for accessing recorded events
  photos identifying suspects as positive externality to offset tax
  
  conversational surplus
  voice is transparent/symmetric/??? UI, more polite when others are around
  other people able to use voice UI is maybe important
  transcribing between contexts is a big feature. audio <-> text
  voice for people nearby, myo/touch for people far away

  
  high-information-density photos and videos are now being used as communication rather than documentation (especially on Snapchat)
  Photos and video taken with Glass will be most useful as a communication tool, rather than as a documentation tool
  http://dcurt.is/photos-for-communication
  "And the resolution of information in a photo, it turns out, is huge when compared to text or even to voice. A photo can tell you where someone is, what time it is, who they are with, and much more. "
  


3) Given these capabilities and social strategic constraints, what does a social network look like for Glass? in the near futrue, not totally restricted to the crurent APIs and hardware (footnote to vague plans for mirror-based dashdash app, distinction from sideloaded apps)
  doing things *together*
  
  communication tools that allows for synchronocity
    Glass is optionally synchronous, the video call in the promo video is cool, but more of the same. if he was playing an instrument that only needed one hand, he could have just used his smartphone.
    optionally synchronous like IM
    great for communicating while doing other things
    technically this is multitasking, but context switching or context integration?
    there's a reason we IM people who are sitting next to us, we dont want to interrupt
    
  implicit social graph
    facebook's social graph, once it's biggest asset, will become it's biggest liability
    google's biggest mistake with G+ will be circles/copying facebook's explicit graph
    I'm sure Google has thought about, and even tried, some of this stuff.
  
  glass is a devices without inboxes for other apps

Even if I don't have Glass, Google needs me to want my friends to be wearing it as much as possible, even if I'm talking with them. 

That's how network effects work – it's easy to think abstractly that SMS, fax machines, and Facebook become more valuable as more people use them, but there's also a very concrete desire that I had/have for my friends to be able to send/receive SMS messages, for companies that I do business with to send/receive faxes (since the alternative was, uh, the USPS), and for everyone I meet to have Facebook. The individuals that make up these network grow the networks through peer pressure, but the social complexities and power asymmetries of Glass require that the pressure come from both inside and outside the network.

As I tweeted to Jenna, vision sharing and frictionless photography is a big deal. Snapchat was revolutionary because it repurposed photography for use as a communication medium, rather than a documentation medium, by making the content only viewable once. Glass is going to drastically decrease the barriers to capturing photos/videos, so I think sharing Snapchat-style "exploding" content on Glass is going to eventually be as mainstream as leaving a voicemail. I'll want my friends to have glass because I'll want to receive those photos/videos, even if I have to take my phone out of my pocket to consume or reciprocate.

If you have glass, and I don't, how can it be useful to me for you to be wearing it while we talk over beers? How can it integrate itself into our conversation? One day I imagine we'll have a searchable record of all of our IRL conversations, which seems useful for the same reasons that chat log archiving and Gmail search are useful, but only one person needs to be making the recording for both people to have access to it later. Permissioning on that information could be automatic too, since Glass should be able to recognize my voice in addition to yours, and can match it to my face or if there's any ambiguity. In addition, it could respect voice commands from either participant to make the conversation "off the record", to perform searches, etc."

> * Proximate Transparency: allow anyone in proximity to access the same feed that the wearer is recording or seeing and e.g. view it through a device of their choosing. Make it easy to identify the Glasses themselves and to trace back to the wearer. This simple act help demystify the technology, create a broader sense ownership of its inclusion in any given space. The reality is very few people would be interested in jacking in and the act of having an open stream will change the behaviour of what is watched. For many this won’t be enough of a step, it is after all an opt-out measure for people who have the technological nous and literacy – forcing people in proximity to do something for dubious gain.
> * Remote Control: allow identifiable people in proximity to control Glass’s recording functionality and have access to the output of what was recorded. Allowing others to demonstrably benefit from the utility of glass will make it part of the social landscape.

smell and taste dont matter since we can't really produce those stimuli in other people (pheremones are subconscious)

In long run doesn't matter whether Google Glass v1 is success or failure. Wearable, context aware, augmented reality is our future.

[^1]: The prominence of the diplay is another concern -- it is both on your own face, and in the face of everyone else -- but I suspect this will be less of an issue than people think. From an industrial design perspective, Glass is remarkably elegant, and won't make the wearer look to be any more or less of a nerd. Furthermore, people are *very* adept at knowing where other people are looking, and I suspect that a glance up-and-to-the-right at the Glass display will be just as obvious, and just as rude, as a Glance down at the iPhone. Even more conspicuously, Glass wearers will need to touch or speak to the device to use it, which will be blatantly obvious if done in the middle of a conversation

[^2]: It's worth noting that other emerging technologies will levy this same tax, and that there's an upper limit to how much attention is required in total. Security cameras, [autonomous food delivery drones](http://tacocopter.com/), and even [gaming consoles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_One#Privacy_concerns) will all have increasingly networked cameras, so perhaps we'll just assume everything is always being recorded. While this future certainly seems bleak, at least Glass wouldn't have an additional adverse affect.

[^3]: I'm also skeptical that Google Now is solving a problem that a large number of people have. Real-time information looks cool in demos, but, personally, my schedule/habits are usually very consistent, and I can navigate my city and manage my schedule without really thinking about it. Also, airports aren't *that* complicated, and having my gate number on my ticket is convenient enough. I could be wrong about this, however, and it's unimportant to my argument.
