[Google Glass][1] has sparked considerable debate about privacy and the role that technology should play in our lives. This public [resistance is certainly *not* futile][2]: the success or failure of Glass depends on whether it can alleviate these concerns and/or provide enough value to offset them. The debate has focused on the camera and, to a lesser extent, microphone[^1]; it’s difficult for people near the Glass wearer to know if they’re being recorded. Frog Design researcher Jan Chipchase [described the consequences of this uncertainty][3]:

>It will be interesting to see whether Glass is perceived as a threatening object and thus may force others in proximity of a wearer to maintain a hyper-awareness of the wearer and their own actions in places — whereas today, they are currently able to relax. This would be, in effect, like a blanket tax on the collective attention of society[^2].

Due to this attention tax, people might prefer that those around them *not* be wearing Glass. Many of the advertised features of Glass are utility apps (such as weather forecasts, email previews, and driving directions with traffic reports), but non-wearers who prefer not to be recorded are indifferent, at best, to the wearer's convenience[^3]. **The key to the success of Glass, then, are apps that are useful not only to the wearer, but also *to other people nearby*.** This requisite benefit to non-wearers is distinct from network effects between Glass wearers: while there will certainly be applications that cause Glass to be more useful as more people have it (as with fax machines and Facebook), the network will be unable to reach critical mass in the face of negative public opinion.

The aspect of Glass most troublesome to those nearby also has the potential to provide them with the most value: the camera. The public reaction to Glass is similar to the public reaction to earlier camera technology. In that same essay, Chipchase paraphrases, and then later quotes, the September 18th, 1885 edition of *Amateur Photographer* magazine. Respectively:

> There is but one remedy for the Glass wearer – a bucket of iced water in the face whenever you suspect he has taken you unawares.  
> [...]  
> There is but one remedy for the amateur photographer. Put a brick through his camera whenever you suspect he has taken you unawares.

Chipchase also links to ['The Camera Fiend'][4], an article by Bill Jay that further details the extreme distaste that was once held for amateur photographs. How did society transition from one in which amateur photographers were derided for privacy violations, to one in which *everyone* is an amateur photographer with a camera in their pocket?

**Cameras became ubiquitous because people valued the images they produce.** It was critical both that people enjoyed using cameras to create the images, *and* that other people enjoyed viewing the images later. Imagine, for a moment, a birthday party in the early days of point-and-shoot cameras: everyone wants to have a friend with a camera to document the celebration[^4], and as a result everyone wants to buy a camera and *be* that friend.

Improvements in both capture technology (medium-format, SLRs, mobile phones, etc.) as well as hardware form-factor (medium-format, SLRs, mobile phones, etc.) have made cameras faster and easier to use, and Glass continues these trends. The camera is ready at a moment's notice with a touch or a voice command[^5], which makes it even easier for the wearer to document social events. This means that non-wearers will get to enjoy more photos/videos than would have otherwise been taken, and also enjoy more of the Glass wearer's attention, who doesn't need to work so hard to capture the images. Wearing is sharing is caring.

These behaviors outline a possible social network focused on image sharing, but more can be done with Glass to both benefit those nearby and differentiate from existing services such as Facebook, Twitter, and Google+. Google+, specifically, is primarily used as a platform for public and community broadcasting, and feels like it was designed to resemble Facebook so it could compete with Facebook. [The service that replaces Facebook, however, will not look like Facebook][5], and Glass will suffer if integrated too tightly with [Google+’s broken social graph][6].

Google not force Glass to be yet-another stage for performative broadcasting, but should rather focus it as a novel device for directed, private communication. The Glass hardware is uniquely suited for having conversations in the moment with people far away using text, images, audio, and video:

{% iframe_embed youtube 9c6W4CCU9M4 ?start=111 %}

Google knows this, as was apparent in the early promotional video above, yet the potential is much broader than simple video phone calls and photos broadcast to social networks. [Dustin Curtis points out][7] that applications have recently begun to use images for *communication*, rather than artistic expression on Instagram or documentation on Facebook. A single photo can carry a large amount of information, and can tell the viewer "where someone is, what time it is, who they are with, and much more." The popularity of Snapchat's ephemeral, exploding content illustrates the communicative potential of images, and the first-person perspective inherent to Glass[^6], as well as the low-friction capture process, are perfect for this use case. The friends and family of Glass wearers can enjoy this unique and personal communicative content even if they don't have Glass themselves[^7].

The opportunity for new communication tools is larger, however, than incrementally-improved versions of apps we have today. **The Glass hardware is well-suited for *optionally synchronous* conversations with individuals and groups who are far away.** Optionally synchronous conversations are somewhere between the synchronicity of a phone call and the asynchronicity of email, and a good example is desktop instant messaging on AIM or Gchat. These services are great for talking with friends while watching television or with coworkers whom you don't want to interrupt, and recipients can respond at their leisure with only an *expectation* of timeliness.

Glass will allow its wearers to integrate these conversations into many new contexts, and these recently-possible conversations will benefit both wearers and non-wearers. The activities featured in the ['How It Feels' promotional video][8] look too engrossing for the wearers to be engaged in a fully synchronous conversation with someone somewhere else. Optionally synchronous conversations are ideal for sharing these experiences with people elsewhere while staying present in the moment. Current mobile devices get cluttered with notifications, but the Glass wearer can engage in a conversation without seeing notifications from other apps, just as a landline telephone user can make a call without checking her voicemail.

There is also an interesting use case for *synchronous* conversations in situations with two or more Glass wearers who are together in one place and have mutual friends or coworkers somewhere else. Current video conferencing tools require that users stay in front of a screen with a camera (Google Hangouts, Skype), hold the mobile device in their hands (Apple Facetime), or sit in a fancy telepresence room like this:

[!["corporate telepresence"](/images/2013/07/telepresence.png)](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Tandberg_Image_Gallery_-_telepresence-t3-side-view-hires.jpg)

As an alternative, imagine two Glass wearers seated across from each other in a restaurant, and a mutual friend in a faraway city who would like to join them from her computer. The Glass wearers can look at each other, and the third friend can see each through the other's camera. If something else captures their interest, then they'll naturally turn toward it, and the third friend will automatically follow their gaze. The video from the third friend's camera would also always be in the field of view of the Glass wearers, rather than off to the side on a screen. Furthermore, audio quality would improve because the Glass microphone is built-in, rather than resting on a conference-room table. **Glass will enable casual, go-anywhere telepresence that helps both wearers and non-wearers [feel like they're *with* friends who are far away][9].**

Social applications for Glass that benefit non-wearers can offset the attention tax inherent in its hardware design. The near-term[^8] success of Glass hinges on whether other people want their friends to be wearing it, *regardless* of whether or not they have Glass themselves. Concerns about privacy and attention can be overcome by social apps that bring people closer together, and Glass has an exciting future as a communication device[^9].

[^1]: Another concern is the prominence of the display: it is both on your own face, and in the face of everyone else. People are *very* adept, however, at knowing where other people are looking, and I suspect that a glance up-and-to-the-right at the Glass display will be just as obvious, and just as rude, as a Glance down at an iPhone. Even more conspicuously, Glass wearers will need to touch or speak to the device to use it, which will be obvious during face-to-face conversations.

[^2]: It's worth noting that other emerging technologies will levy this same tax, and that there's an upper limit to how much attention is required in total. Security cameras, [autonomous delivery drones](http://tacocopter.com/), and even [gaming consoles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_One#Privacy_concerns) will all have increasingly networked cameras, so perhaps we'll just assume everything is always being recorded. While that future certainly seems bleak, at least Glass wouldn't have an additional adverse effect.

[^3]: I'm also skeptical that these [Google Now](http://www.google.com/landing/now/) features are solving a problem that a large number of people have. Real-time information looks cool in demos, but my schedule/habits are generally consistent, I can navigate my city without really thinking about it, and airports aren't *that* complicated. Regardless, this is not important to the rest of the post.

[^4]: Some people, of course, don't enjoy looking at photos and don't like to have their picture taken. While they might be nonplussed by Glass as an evolution of previous cameras, they might still be interested in the potential of Glass as a communication device.

[^5]: While there are certain stigmas around talking to our devices in public, these voice interfaces have the benefit of being *transparent*: if I say "ok glass, take a picture," then everyone around me knows that I just took a picture. Glass will make those adjacent to the wearer more comfortable by requiring that users verbally broadcast their usage of the device. In addition, voice interfaces can be used by others. This is often portrayed as a humorous weakness of Glass, since a non-wearer might say, "ok glass, google for photos of [something obscene]," but social norms can easily regulate such behavior.

[^6]: Given the popularity of the selfie, how long will it be until there is a press conference announcing Google Hand Mirror?

[^7]: I have an idea for app along these lines that I'm hoping to build with the [Mirror API](http://developers.google.com/glass/) (as opposed to the undocumented and unsupported ["sideloading" Android API](http://developers.google.com/events/io/sessions/332704837)). I'll post more details when I have something working!

[^8]: There are many questions about the long-term consequences of Glass:<ul><li>Will every surface be [covered in digital advertising](http://vimeo.com/8569187)? Maybe, if we're compensated well enough for viewing them. Also, perhaps there is an advertising equilibrium, where the world is so saturated with advertising that, given fixed disposable income, it's no longer worth it for companies to purchase more.</li><li>Will Google use Glass to collect ambient personal data against our wishes, and then make it accessible to those whom we'd rather not have it? Mark Hursts's post on this topic [raises interesting questions](http://creativegood.com/blog/the-google-glass-feature-no-one-is-talking-about/), but the technology isn't there yet.</li><li>Will Google engineers [control our thoughts](http://vimeo.com/46304267)? Anything is possible given enough time, but this seems *way* too far away to worry about, and I'm sure there would be safeguards against true "Glassholes" like the one in the film (to put it kindly).</li></ul>These concerns are worth talking about in depth, but were outside of the scope of this post.

[^9]: I've been [invited to the Glass Explorer program](http://twitter.com/googleglass/status/316970853969584128), and I'm scheduled to pick up my device tomorrow. My three [#ifihadglass](http://web.archive.org/web/20130220191606/http://www.google.com/glass/start/how-to-get-one/) applications are [here](http://twitter.com/lehrblogger/status/306132195498676226), [here](http://twitter.com/lehrblogger/status/306907092176994304), and [here](http://twitter.com/lehrblogger/status/306926304899502080). I've thought a lot about whether the $1500+tax price tag is worth it, but Glass represents a future worth exploring, and I'm excited about the opportunities. As [@amybijamy said on Twitter](http://twitter.com/amybijamy/status/316986164932390912), "It's like getting into Hogwarts!"
