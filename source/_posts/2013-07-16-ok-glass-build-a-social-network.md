[Google Glass][1] has sparked considerable debate about privacy and the role that technology should play in our lives. This public [resistance is certainly *not* futile][2]: the success or failure of Glass depends on whether it can alleviate these concerns and/or provide so much value that people tolerate it anyway. The camera, and to a lesser extent the microphone, are perhaps the biggest issues[^1]; because the hardware is always in the same place, even when not in use, people in the vicinity of the Glass wearer won't know if they are being recorded. (Cell phones, in contrast, are held differently when the user is taking a photo, and prior cameras had lens caps.) Frog Design researcher Jan Chipchase [described the consequences of this uncertainty][3]:

>It will be interesting to see whether Glass is perceived as a threatening object and thus may force others in proximity of a wearer to maintain a hyper-awareness of the wearer and their own actions in places — whereas today, they are currently able to relax. This would be, in effect, like a blanket tax on the collective attention of society[^2].

Due to this attention tax, people will prefer that those around them *not* be wearing Glass, no matter how useful it is to the wearer. Many of the advertised features of Glass are utility apps, such as the clock, weather forecasts, driving directions with traffic reports, breaking news notifications, and email previews, but non-wearers who prefer not to be recorded are indifferent, at best, to the wearer's convenience[^3]. **The key to the success of Glass, then, are apps that are useful not only to the wearer, but also *to other people nearby*.** If the tax on our collective attention is a negative externality, then Glass needs a positive externality to balance it. This positive externality is distinct from network effects between people who have Glass: while there will certainly be applications that cause Glass to be more useful as more people have it (as with fax machines and Facebook), the network will be unable to reach critical mass in the face of negative public opinion.

The aspect of Glass most troublesome to those nearby also has the potential to provide them with the most value: the camera. Glass is not causing the first-ever furor around photography, and it's instructive to compare Glass to previously-new recording technologies. In that same essay, Chipchase paraphrases, and then later quotes, the September 18th, 1885 edition of *Amateur Photographer* magazine. Respectively:

> There is but one remedy for the Glass wearer – a bucket of iced water in the face whenever you suspect he has taken you unawares.  
> [...]  
> There is but one remedy for the amateur photographer. Put a brick through his camera whenever you suspect he has taken you unawares.

Chipchase also links to ['The Camera Fiend'][4], an article by Bill Jay that details the extreme distaste that was once held for amateur photographs. How did society transition from one in which amateur photographers were derided for privacy violations, to one in which *everyone* is an amateur photographer with a camera in their pocket?

**Cameras became ubiquitous because people enjoy the images they produce.** If people merely enjoyed using cameras to *create* the images, that would be insufficient, due to the Glass-like negative externalities. The balancing positive externality is that people in addition to the photographer are able to enjoy the images after they are taken. Imagine, for a moment, a birthday party in the early days of point-and-shoot cameras: everyone wants to have a friend with a camera to document the celebration, and as a result everyone wants to buy a camera and *be* that friend.

Improvements in both capture technology (from Daguerreotypes, to wet plates, to dry plates, to film, to digital sensors) as well as hardware form-factor (from large-format, to medium-format, to rangefinders, to SLRs, to point-and-shoot digital cameras, to mobile phones) have made cameras faster and easier to use, and the Glass camera continues these trends. It is available at a moment's notice with a touch or a voice command[^4], which makes it even easier for the wearer to document social events. This means that non-wearers will get to enjoy more photos/videos than would have otherwise been taken, and also enjoy more of the Glass wearer's attention, who doesn't need to work so hard to capture the images. Wearing is sharing is caring.

These behaviors outline a possible social network focused on image sharing, but more can be done with Glass to both benefit those nearby and differentiate from existing services like Facebook. While Google has said they [will not yet be approving any facial recognition apps][5], Glass and accompanying apps for other platforms could use a combination of GPS/location data, voice recognition, and [ambient background noise matching][6] to figure out which people are in the same social contexts[^5]. Glass could then, as Chipchase suggests:

>allow identifiable people in proximity to control Glass’s recording functionality and have access to the output of what was recorded. Allowing others to demonstrably benefit from the utility of Glass will make it part of the social landscape.

"Remote control" and automatic sharing transfer some of the attention tax back to the Glass wearer -- if others can see what she is looking at, she has to be more mindful of her gaze -- while also providing value to those nearby. In addition, Glass has a data connection, so the wearer can send or share those images as they are taken and provide value to people far away.

Google knows this, as was apparent in the early promo video above, yet the potential is much broader than simple video phone calls and photos broadcast to social networks. [Dustin Curtis points out][7] that applications have recently begun to use images for *communication*, rather than artistic expression on Instagram or documentation on Facebook. A single photo can carry a large amount of information, and can tell the viewer "where someone is, what time it is, who they are with, and much more." The popularity of Snapchat's ephemeral, exploding content illustrates the communicative potential of images, and the first-person perspective inherent to Glass[^6], as well as the low-friction capture process, are perfect for this use case. The friends and family of Glass wearers can enjoy this unique and personal communicative content even if they don't have Glass themselves[^7].

The opportunity for new communication tools is larger, however, than incrementally-improved versions of apps we have today. The Glass hardware is well-suited for **optionally synchronous** conversations with individuals and groups who are far away. Optionally synchronous conversations are somewhere between the synchronicity of a phone call and the asynchronicity of email, and a good example is desktop instant messaging on AIM or Gchat. This type of communication is great for communicating with friends while watching television or with co-workers whom you don't want to interrupt, and recipients can respond at their leisure with only an *expectation* of timeliness. While multitasking required by optionally synchronous interactions can be distracting, people still find it useful to integrate IM conversations into other contexts.

Glass will allow its wearers to integrate conversations into many new contexts, and these recently-possible conversations will benefit both wearers and non-wearers. The activities featured in the [How It Feels promo video][8] look too engrossing for the wearers to be engaged in a fully synchronous conversation with someone somewhere else. Optionally synchronous conversations seem like the perfect way for the wearer to share these experiences with people elsewhere while staying present in the moment. This would be a substantial improvement over the usage of mobile phones for similar purposes, especially because these devices tend to be used for many, many different things -- a user will look down at her phone to respond to message via iMessage or WhatsApp, and get distracted by an @-reply on Twitter, some breaking news, four new emails, and a spammy notification from an app she's never used. Glass simply lacks a screen big enough to be this annoying.

There is also an interesting use case for synchronous conversations in situations with two or more Glass wearers who are together in one place and have mutual friends or co-workers somewhere else. Currently, video conferencing tools require that users be seated in front of a screen with a camera (Google Hangouts, Skype) or hold the mobile device in their hands (Facetime), or stay seated in a fancy telepresence room like this:

[!["corporate telepresence"](/images/2013/07/telepresence.png)](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Tandberg_Image_Gallery_-_telepresence-t3-side-view-hires.jpg)

As an alternative, imagine two Glass wearers seated across from each other in a restaurant, and a mutual friend in a far-away city who would like to join them from her computer. The Glass wearers can look at each other, and the third friend can see each through the other's camera. If something else captures their interest, then they'll naturally turn toward it, and the third friend will automatically follow their gaze. The video from the third friend's camera would also always be in the field of view of the Glass wearers, rather than off to the side on a screen. Furthermore, having redundant microphones that are always close to those speaking would improve audio quality for the far-away friend. The casual, go-anywhere telepresence enabled by Glass will let both wearers and non-wearers [feel like they're *with* friends who are far away][9].

Social applications for Glass that benefit non-wearers can offset the negative externalities associated with its unique hardware. The near-term[^8] success of Glass hinges on whether other people want their friends to be wearing it, *regardless* of whether or not they have Glass themselves. Glass is a [significant changes in the hardware layer][10] and creates new opportunities for social networks in the application layer. Concerns about privacy and attention can be overcome by social apps that bring people closer together, and I'm excited about this future[^9].

[^1]: The prominence of the display is another concern -- it is both on your own face, and in the face of everyone else -- but I suspect this will be less of an issue than people think. From an industrial design perspective, Glass is remarkably elegant. Furthermore, people are *very* adept at knowing where other people are looking, and I suspect that a glance up-and-to-the-right at the Glass display will be just as obvious, and just as rude, as a Glance down at an iPhone. Even more conspicuously, Glass wearers will need to touch or speak to the device to use it, which will be blatantly obvious if done in the middle of a conversation

[^2]: It's worth noting that other emerging technologies will levy this same tax, and that there's an upper limit to how much attention is required in total. Security cameras, [autonomous food delivery drones](http://tacocopter.com/), and even [gaming consoles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_One#Privacy_concerns) will all have increasingly networked cameras, so perhaps we'll just assume everything is always being recorded. While that future certainly seems bleak, at least Glass wouldn't have an additional adverse effect.

[^3]: I'm also skeptical that these [Google Now](http://www.google.com/landing/now/) features are solving a problem that a large number of people have. Real-time information looks cool in demos, but, personally, my schedule/habits are usually very consistent, and I can navigate my city and manage my schedule without really thinking about it. Also, airports aren't *that* complicated, and having my gate number on my ticket is convenient enough. I could be wrong about this, however, and it's unimportant to my argument.

[^4]: While there are certain stigmas around talking to our devices in public, these voice interfaces have the benefit of being *transparent*: if I say "ok glass, take a picture," then everyone around me knows that I just took a picture. Glass will make those adjacent to the wearer more comfortable by requiring that users verbally broadcast their usage of the device. In addition, voice interfaces can be used by others. This is widely seen as a humorous weakness of Glass, since a non-wearer might say, "ok glass, google for photos of [something obscene]," but social norms will regulate such behavior, and it's actually a strength because it further integrates Glass into Chipchase's "social landscape."

[^5]: It seems likely that Google has tried some of these things, and there will certainly be challenges, but I'm confident that our social graphs will eventually be defined *implicitly* by our choices about who we communicate with. This is in contrast to the design of existing social networks, where we explicitly and manually Follow, add Friends, or [sort people into Circles](/2011/07/06/the-problem-with-circles-and-the-pleasure-of-carbon-copy/), and more similar to how social networks work in real life, where we automatically and subconsciously keep track of our ever-changing relationships.

[^6]: Given the popularity of the selfie, how long will it be until there is a press conference announcing Google Hand Mirror?

[^7]: I have an idea for app along these lines that I'm hoping to build with the [Mirror API](http://developers.google.com/glass/) (although there is also the undocumented and unsupported ["sideloading" Android API](http://developers.google.com/events/io/sessions/332704837)). I'll post more details when I have something working!

[^8]: There are many questions about the long-term consequences of Glass:<ul><li>Will every surface be [covered in digital advertising](http://vimeo.com/8569187)? Maybe, if we're compensated well viewing them. People will only have so much money to spend on the advertised goods, however, so the economics seem unlikely to work out.</li><li>Will Google require the collection of ambient personal data against our wishes, and then make it accessible to those whom we'd rather not have it? Mark Hursts's post on this topic [raises interesting questions](http://creativegood.com/blog/the-google-glass-feature-no-one-is-talking-about/), but the technology isn't there yet.</li><li>Will Google engineers [control our thoughts](http://vimeo.com/46304267)? Anything is possible given enough time, but this seems *way* too far away to worry about, and I'm sure there would be safeguards against true "Glassholes" like the one in the film (to put it kindly).</li></ul>These things are worth talking about in depth, but were outside of the scope of this post.

[^9]: I've been [invited to the Glass Explorer program](http://twitter.com/googleglass/status/316970853969584128), and I'm scheduled to pick up my device tomorrow. My three [#ifihadglass](http://web.archive.org/web/20130220191606/http://www.google.com/glass/start/how-to-get-one/) applications are [here](http://twitter.com/lehrblogger/status/306132195498676226), [here](http://twitter.com/lehrblogger/status/306907092176994304), and [here](http://twitter.com/lehrblogger/status/306926304899502080). I've thought a lot about whether the $1500+tax price tag is worth it, but I stand behind what I've written above. Glass represents a future worth exploring, and I'm excited about the opportunities. As [@amybijamy said on Twitter](http://twitter.com/amybijamy/status/316986164932390912), "It's like getting into Hogwarts!"
