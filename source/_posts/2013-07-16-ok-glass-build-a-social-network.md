[Google Glass][1] has sparked considerable debate about privacy and the role that technology should play in our lives. This public [resistance is certainly *not* futile][2]: the success or failure of Glass depends on whether it can alleviate these concerns and/or provide enough value to offset them. This resistance is focused on the camera and, to a lesser extent, microphone[^1]; it’s difficult for people near the Glass wearer to know if they’re being recorded. Frog Design researcher Jan Chipchase [described the consequences of this uncertainty][3]:

>It will be interesting to see whether Glass is perceived as a threatening object and thus may force others in proximity of a wearer to maintain a hyper-awareness of the wearer and their own actions in places — whereas today, they are currently able to relax. This would be, in effect, like a blanket tax on the collective attention of society[^2].

Due to this attention tax, people will prefer that those around them *not* be wearing Glass. Many of the advertised features of Glass are utility apps (such as weather forecasts, email previews, and driving directions with traffic reports), but non-wearers who prefer not to be recorded are indifferent, at best, to the wearer's convenience[^3]. **The key to the success of Glass, then, are apps that are useful not only to the wearer, but also *to other people nearby*.** This requisite benefit to non-wearers is distinct from network effects Glass wearers: while there will certainly be applications that cause Glass to be more useful as more people have it (as with fax machines and Facebook), the network will be unable to reach critical mass in the face of negative public opinion.

The aspect of Glass most troublesome to those nearby also has the potential to provide them with the most value: the camera. The public reaction to Glass is similar to the public reaction to earlier cameras. In that same essay, Chipchase paraphrases, and then later quotes, the September 18th, 1885 edition of *Amateur Photographer* magazine. Respectively:

> There is but one remedy for the Glass wearer – a bucket of iced water in the face whenever you suspect he has taken you unawares.  
> [...]  
> There is but one remedy for the amateur photographer. Put a brick through his camera whenever you suspect he has taken you unawares.

Chipchase also links to ['The Camera Fiend'][4], an article by Bill Jay that details the extreme distaste that was once held for amateur photographs. How did society transition from one in which amateur photographers were derided for privacy violations, to one in which *everyone* is an amateur photographer with a camera in their pocket?

**Cameras became ubiquitous because people valued the images they produce.** It was critical that people enjoyed using cameras to create the images, *and* that other people enjoyed viewing the images later. Imagine, for a moment, a birthday party in the early days of point-and-shoot cameras: everyone wants to have a friend with a camera to document the celebration, and as a result everyone wants to buy a camera and *be* that friend.

Improvements in both capture technology (from Daguerreotypes, to wet plates, to dry plates, to film, to digital sensors) as well as hardware form-factor (from large-format, to medium-format, to rangefinders, to SLRs, to point-and-shoot digital cameras, to mobile phones) have made cameras faster and easier to use, and the Glass camera continues these trends. The camera is ready at a moment's notice with a touch or a voice command[^4], which makes it even easier for the wearer to document social events. This means that non-wearers will get to enjoy more photos/videos than would have otherwise been taken, and also enjoy more of the Glass wearer's attention, who doesn't need to work so hard to capture the images. Wearing is sharing is caring.

These behaviors outline a possible social network focused on image sharing, but more can be done with Glass to both benefit those nearby and differentiate from existing services such as Facebook, Twitter, and Google+. Google+, specifically, is primarily used as a platform for public broadcasting and community conversation, and feels like it was built to be as similar to Facebook as possible so that it could compete effectively with Facebook. [The service that replaces Facebook, however, will not look like Facebook][5], and Google would do better to focus on the unique, hardware-layer potential of Glass as a communication device, rather than shoehorn it into the social platform of yesterday.

There are several ways that Glass-specific apps could determine who else is nearby the Glass wearer. While Google has said they [will not yet be approving any facial recognition apps][6], Glass and accompanying apps for other platforms could use a combination of GPS/location data, voice recognition, and [ambient background noise matching][7][^5]. Glass could then, as Chipchase suggests:

>allow identifiable people in proximity to control Glass’s recording functionality and have access to the output of what was recorded. Allowing others to demonstrably benefit from the utility of Glass will make it part of the social landscape.

"Remote control" and automatic sharing transfer some of the attention tax back to the Glass wearer -- if others can see what she is looking at, she has to be more mindful of her gaze -- while also providing value to those nearby. In addition, Glass has a data connection, so the wearer can send or share those images as they are taken and provide value to people far away.

{% iframe_embed youtube 9c6W4CCU9M4 ?start=111 %}

Google knows this, as was apparent in the early promotional video above, yet the potential is much broader than simple video phone calls and photos broadcast to social networks. [Dustin Curtis points out][8] that applications have recently begun to use images for *communication*, rather than artistic expression on Instagram or documentation on Facebook. A single photo can carry a large amount of information, and can tell the viewer "where someone is, what time it is, who they are with, and much more." The popularity of Snapchat's ephemeral, exploding content illustrates the communicative potential of images, and the first-person perspective inherent to Glass[^6], as well as the low-friction capture process, are perfect for this use case. The friends and family of Glass wearers can enjoy this unique and personal communicative content even if they don't have Glass themselves[^7].

The opportunity for new communication tools is larger, however, than incrementally-improved versions of apps we have today. **The Glass hardware is well-suited for *optionally synchronous* conversations with individuals and groups who are far away.** Optionally synchronous conversations are somewhere between the synchronicity of a phone call and the asynchronicity of email, and a good example is desktop instant messaging on AIM or Gchat. This type of communication is great for communicating with friends while watching television or with co-workers whom you don't want to interrupt, and recipients can respond at their leisure with only an *expectation* of timeliness.

Glass will allow its wearers to integrate these conversations into many new contexts, and these recently-possible conversations will benefit both wearers and non-wearers. The activities featured in the [How It Feels promotional video][9] look too engrossing for the wearers to be engaged in a fully synchronous conversation with someone somewhere else. Optionally synchronous conversations seem like the perfect way for the wearer to share these experiences with people elsewhere while staying present in the moment. Current mobile devices get cluttered with notifications that make them difficult to use for messaging. The Glass wearer, in contrast, can engage in a conversation without seeing notifications from other apps, just as a landline telephone user can make a call without checking her voicemail.

There is also an interesting use case for synchronous conversations in situations with two or more Glass wearers who are together in one place and have mutual friends or co-workers somewhere else. Currently, video conferencing tools require that users be seated in front of a screen with a camera (Google Hangouts, Skype) or hold the mobile device in their hands (Facetime), or stay seated in a fancy telepresence room like this:

[!["corporate telepresence"](/images/2013/07/telepresence.png)](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Tandberg_Image_Gallery_-_telepresence-t3-side-view-hires.jpg)

As an alternative, imagine two Glass wearers seated across from each other in a restaurant, and a mutual friend in a faraway city who would like to join them from her computer. The Glass wearers can look at each other, and the third friend can see each through the other's camera. If something else captures their interest, then they'll naturally turn toward it, and the third friend will automatically follow their gaze. The video from the third friend's camera would also always be in the field of view of the Glass wearers, rather than off to the side on a screen. Furthermore, having redundant microphones that are always close to those speaking would improve audio quality for the faraway friend. **Glass will enable casual, go-anywhere telepresence that helps both wearers and non-wearers [feel like they're *with* friends who are far away][10].**

Social applications for Glass that benefit non-wearers can offset attention tax inherent in its hardware design. The near-term[^8] success of Glass hinges on whether other people want their friends to be wearing it, *regardless* of whether or not they have Glass themselves. Concerns about privacy and attention can be overcome by social apps that bring people closer together -- Glass as a communication device, reveals exciting opportunities for the future[^9].

[^1]: The prominence of the display is another concern -- it is both on your own face, and in the face of everyone else -- but I suspect this will be less of an issue than people think. From an industrial design perspective, Glass is remarkably elegant. Furthermore, people are *very* adept at knowing where other people are looking, and I suspect that a glance up-and-to-the-right at the Glass display will be just as obvious, and just as rude, as a Glance down at an iPhone. Even more conspicuously, Glass wearers will need to touch or speak to the device to use it, which will be blatantly obvious if done in the middle of a conversation

[^2]: It's worth noting that other emerging technologies will levy this same tax, and that there's an upper limit to how much attention is required in total. Security cameras, [autonomous food delivery drones](http://tacocopter.com/), and even [gaming consoles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_One#Privacy_concerns) will all have increasingly networked cameras, so perhaps we'll just assume everything is always being recorded. While that future certainly seems bleak, at least Glass wouldn't have an additional adverse effect.

[^3]: I'm also skeptical that these [Google Now](http://www.google.com/landing/now/) features are solving a problem that a large number of people have. Real-time information looks cool in demos, but, personally, my schedule/habits are usually very consistent, and I can navigate my city and manage my schedule without really thinking about it. Also, airports aren't *that* complicated, and having my gate number on my ticket is convenient enough. I could be wrong about this, however, and it's unimportant to my argument.

[^4]: While there are certain stigmas around talking to our devices in public, these voice interfaces have the benefit of being *transparent*: if I say "ok glass, take a picture," then everyone around me knows that I just took a picture. Glass will make those adjacent to the wearer more comfortable by requiring that users verbally broadcast their usage of the device. In addition, voice interfaces can be used by others. This is widely seen as a humorous weakness of Glass, since a non-wearer might say, "ok glass, google for photos of [something obscene]," but social norms will regulate such behavior, and it's actually a strength because it further integrates Glass into Chipchase's "social landscape."

[^5]: It seems likely that Google has tried some of these things, and there will certainly be challenges, but I'm confident that our social graphs will eventually be defined *implicitly* by our choices about who we communicate with. This is in contrast to the design of existing social networks, where we explicitly and manually Follow, add Friends, or [sort people into Circles](/2011/07/06/the-problem-with-circles-and-the-pleasure-of-carbon-copy/), and more similar to how social networks work in real life, where we automatically and subconsciously keep track of our ever-changing relationships.

[^6]: Given the popularity of the selfie, how long will it be until there is a press conference announcing Google Hand Mirror?

[^7]: I have an idea for app along these lines that I'm hoping to build with the [Mirror API](http://developers.google.com/glass/) (although there is also the undocumented and unsupported ["sideloading" Android API](http://developers.google.com/events/io/sessions/332704837)). I'll post more details when I have something working!

[^8]: There are many questions about the long-term consequences of Glass:<ul><li>Will every surface be [covered in digital advertising](http://vimeo.com/8569187)? Maybe, if we're compensated well enough for viewing them. Also, perhaps there is an advertising equilibrium, where the world is so saturated with advertising that, given fixed disposable income, it's no longer worth it for companies to purchase more.</li><li>Will Google use Glass to collect ambient personal data against our wishes, and then make it accessible to those whom we'd rather not have it? Mark Hursts's post on this topic [raises interesting questions](http://creativegood.com/blog/the-google-glass-feature-no-one-is-talking-about/), but the technology isn't there yet.</li><li>Will Google engineers [control our thoughts](http://vimeo.com/46304267)? Anything is possible given enough time, but this seems *way* too far away to worry about, and I'm sure there would be safeguards against true "Glassholes" like the one in the film (to put it kindly).</li></ul>These concerns are worth talking about in depth, but were outside of the scope of this post.

[^9]: I've been [invited to the Glass Explorer program](http://twitter.com/googleglass/status/316970853969584128), and I'm scheduled to pick up my device tomorrow. My three [#ifihadglass](http://web.archive.org/web/20130220191606/http://www.google.com/glass/start/how-to-get-one/) applications are [here](http://twitter.com/lehrblogger/status/306132195498676226), [here](http://twitter.com/lehrblogger/status/306907092176994304), and [here](http://twitter.com/lehrblogger/status/306926304899502080). I've thought a lot about whether the $1500+tax price tag is worth it, but I stand behind what I've written above. Glass represents a future worth exploring, and I'm excited about the opportunities. As [@amybijamy said on Twitter](http://twitter.com/amybijamy/status/316986164932390912), "It's like getting into Hogwarts!"
