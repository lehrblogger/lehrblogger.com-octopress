For this assignment, Amanda and I each built a circuit with an Arduino, an XBee radio, a potentiometer, and several LEDs. They were paired such that adjusting the potentiometer on one brightens or dims an LED on the other.

The assignment was based heavily on the exercises in Chapter 6 of Tom Igoe's book *Making Things Talk* ([amazon][1]).

The Arduino code is online [here][2].
