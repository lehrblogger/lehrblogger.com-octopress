Facebook wants to be the last great social network[^1]. 

This ambition is especially clear

They have over a billion users, but still rally behind the cry, "[This journey is 1% finished.][1]"

[^1]

“They’re the future for now,” he replied. “But nothing is the future forever.”http://www.vanityfair.com/business/2013/05/facebook-future-mark-zuckerberg-sheryl-sandberg

all future social applications will be built on facebook, pervasive

There is certainly still a lot of work to be done, as communication technologies are constantly evolving, but neither Facebook nor any other company will do more than a fraction of this work.

Facebook rose to dominance as an application running in a web browser on desktop computers, but recently consumer attention has shifted to mobile apps on iOS and Android. This shift is not unique, but rather simply the most recent disruption in a long history of evolving communications technology. It's useful to think of these technologies as four distinct layers[^2]:

 1. **Data networks** (as opposed to social networks): satellites, telephone wires, mail trucks
 2. **End-user hardware**: mobile phones, desktop computers, rotary telephones
 3. **Operating systems**: iOS, Android, Mac OS X, Windows, web browsers
 4. **Applications**: Facebook, email, SMS

Some of these layers are merged or missing in some communication technologies (such as hand-written letters), or duplicated in others (rich web applications like Facebook treat the browser as an OS, even though there is also a host OS). The model is useful for understanding which technologies at higher levels will be disrupted by changes in the foundational levels upon which they are built.
 
Nine-year-old Facebook has struggled to adapt to the shifts from web browsers to mobile phones. It [acquired photo-sharing app/network Instagram][2] to strengthen its mobile presence, yet other competitive mobile apps have continued to grow exponentially: users of two-year-old Snapchat now send [200 million photos per day][3], and users of four-year-old WhatsApp send [10 billion messages per day][4][^3]. Can Facebook can transition successfully to mobile, by either defeating or paying off[^4] these barbarians at its gates? Perhaps for now, but not forever.

[!["'Destruction' by Thomas Cole"](/images/2013/06/Cole_Thomas_The_Course_of_Empire_Destruction_1836.jpg)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Cole_Thomas_The_Course_of_Empire_Destruction_1836.jpg)

There is nothing unique about the current shift in consumer attention from desktop to mobile. Past examples include:

 * **Telegraphs**, a new network-layer technology that created opportunities for telegraph manufacturers and operators, but hurt the steam ship operators carrying letters across the Atlantic.
 * **Cell phone cameras**, a new hardware-layer technology that enabled consumers to share single photos as they were taken, rather than wait until they were at a computer to upload an album, thus enabling entirely new photo-sharing applications.
 * **3G data networks**, a new network-layer technology that enabled users of WhatsApp and other messaging applications to bypass [exorbitant SMS fees][5] (among many other things).
 * **Address book APIs**, a new OS-layer technology that let applications request access to the contacts on a user's device, and then match those names/emails/phone numbers with other uploaded address books to automatically find the new user's friends, thus undermining Facebook's monopoly on the social graph [^5].

In each case the changes in underlying technology enabled new consumer behaviors and disrupted old monetization strategies. The current mobile devices are certainly not the apex of communication technology. For example, regardless of the whether Google can foster healthy social conventions around [Glass][6], it's clear that we will have wearable communication devices, and that those devices will enable yet-to-be-imagined application-layer user experiences. And there will be many future technologies after Glass at the network, hardware, and OS layers, each destabilizing the application layer where Facebook has built its empire.

It is difficult for established companies to anticipate these changes and execute accordingly. Timing and branding are important, as evidenced by Facebook [Poke][7], the clone of Snapchat that never gained marketshare. In order for Facebook to remain the dominant social network, they have to anticipate and execute on *every* change, and each innovation that gets made elsewhere is like a rebellious province that gains independence. Facebook also can't rely on network effects between users to protect its borders -- [Albert Wenger from Union Square Ventures has said][8] that network effects "work very well on the way up, but they also work very well on the way down."

To make things even more difficult for Facebook, successful products have inertia due to both economic incentives and user habits. Currently, Facebook makes the vast majority of their revenue from advertising, and is [working hard to increase their revenue from mobile advertising][9]. It remains to be seen how effective mobile advertising can be, and it's even possible that one of the underlying reasons *for* the consumer shift from desktop to mobile is the relative scarcity and inefficacy of ads. Meanwhile, new companies have successfully developed other monetization strategies, unburdened by Facebook's existing advertising infrastructure, large sales teams, and ever-critical Wall Street analysts.

WhatsApp, for example, simply [charges $0.99 for their app][10], while [Line][11], a messaging application popular in Japan, was one of the first to sell cute 'sticker' images to users that they could then send to their friends. Line sold [$17 million worth][12] of digital stickers in Q1 2013; with [~$1.46 billion in revenue in that same quarter][13], it would be difficult for Facebook to make stickers a meaningful source of revenue. The strategy that is working for the barbarians is unlikely to scale for a sprawling empire.

Even if these other strategies could work for Facebook, it's difficult for a company to move away from existing successful revenue streams in favor of tangential long-term gambles. This challenge is related to [Clay Christensen's Innovator's Dilemma][14]: established firms are vulnerable to smaller companies with disruptive and low-margin technologies that, over time, become profitable and overtake those of the established firms. Should Facebook spend resources developing for wearable devices, and risk being too early or building the wrong thing? Or should they wait until the market is established and the interaction paradigms proven, and risk being too late?

These questions are not particular to Facebook and its products and strategies, but rather fundamental to the market for communication technology. Facebook, [mired by their secrets][15] and moored by a billion users clicking on advertisements and Like buttons, will not be the last great social network, although they may still make a lot more money and might never disappear completely. Nor will Facebook be the second-to-last great social network -- whatever company comes next will face all of the same challenges, and will eventually be replaced for the same reasons. Each new great social network will look different from the previous great social network, because they will be built on a different stack of technologies. Each new great social network will be great for us, the users, because they will bring us ever closer to people who are far away.

[^1]: The paintings do not actually depict Ancient Rome (the last great civilization?), but rather an imaginary city. Titled *[The Consummation of Empire](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:The_Course_of_Empire_Consummation_Thomas_Cole_1835_1836.jpeg)*, *[Destruction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Cole_Thomas_The_Course_of_Empire_Destruction_1836.jpg)* and *[The Arcadian or Pastoral State](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Cole_Thomas_The_Course_of_Empire_The_Arcadian_or_Pastoral_State_1836.jpg)*, respectively, they were painted by [Thomas Cole](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Cole) from 1833-36 as part of his five-part series *[The Course of Empire](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Course_of_Empire)*.

[^2]: The layer terminology was inspired by Steve Cheney's differentiation between application and infrastructure layers in [Google Voice and FaceTime – Why the Carriers Are Losing Their Voice](http://techcrunch.com/2010/11/07/google-voice-and-facetime-why-the-carriers-are-losing-their-voice/), but there are also clear similarities to the seven-layer [OSI model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven-layer_model) (which does not [refer to a burrito](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fow7iUaKrq4&t=1m49s)).

[^3]: There are *many* messaging apps similar to WhatsApp, including: [Line](http://line.naver.jp/en/) (mentioned later), [WeChat](http://wechat.com/en/), [Kakao Talk](http://www.kakao.com/talk/en), [Kik](http://kik.com/), [Hike](http://get.hike.in/), [Path](https://path.com/), and [MessageMe](http://messageme.com/).

[^4]: Snapchat is currently valued at [$860 million](http://www.forbes.com/sites/jjcolao/2013/06/24/snapchat-raises-60-million-from-ivp-at-800-million-valuation/), and WhatsApp is perhaps worth [$1.1 billion](http://stevecheney.posterous.com/facebook-and-whatsapp-whats-a-consumer-networ), so Facebook could probably just buy them both and be done with it... but they cannot afford to do that with every successful competitive app forever. Furthermore, just as Facebook declined early acquisition efforts, these new companies may simply be unwilling to sell at a reasonable price.

[^5]: Address book matching has been around for a while, but has recently become increasingly common. It was perhaps [pioneered by Kik](http://venturebeat.com/2010/11/03/kik-messenger-sees-explosive-start-a-mobile-chat-better-than-sms/), and [Path was fined by the FTC](http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2013/02/path.shtm) for automatically collecting this data. [Josh Miller](https://twitter.com/joshm) has written more recently about this new social graph portability [here](https://medium.com/musings-about-text-boxes/8157c364d26a).
