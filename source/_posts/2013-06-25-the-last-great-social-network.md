Facebook wants to be the last great social network. Zuckerberg is "[building a web where the default is social][0]" and trying to make Facebook the foundation for all future social applications. They have over a billion active users, yet still rally behind the cry, "[This journey is 1% finished.][1]" Social applications certainly have a long way to go, but communication technologies are constantly evolving, so neither Facebook nor any other application will be the *last* great social network.

Facebook rose to dominance as an application running in a web browser on desktop computers, but recently consumer attention has shifted to mobile apps on iOS and Android. This shift is not unique, but rather simply the most recent disruption in a long history of evolving communications technology. It's useful to think of this stack of technologies as consisting of four distinct layers[^1]:

 1. **Data networks**: satellites, telephone wires, mail trucks
 2. **End-user hardware**: mobile phones, desktop computers, rotary telephones
 3. **Operating systems**: iOS, Android, Mac OS X, Windows, web browsers
 4. **Applications**: Facebook, MySpace, GMail, iMessage

These layers may be merged or missing in some communication technologies (such as hand-written letters), or duplicated in others (rich web applications like Facebook treat the browser as an OS, even though there is also a host OS). The model is useful for understanding which technologies at higher levels will be disrupted by changes in the foundational levels upon which they are built.
 
Nine-year-old Facebook has struggled to adapt to the shifts from web browsers to mobile phones. It [acquired photo-sharing app/network Instagram][2] to strengthen its mobile presence, yet other competitive mobile apps have continued to grow exponentially: users of two-year-old Snapchat now send [200 million photos per day][3], and users of four-year-old WhatsApp send [10 billion messages per day][4][^2]. Can Facebook can transition successfully to mobile, by either defeating or paying off[^3] these barbarians at its gates?

[!["'Destruction' by Thomas Cole"](/images/2013/06/Cole_Thomas_The_Course_of_Empire_Destruction_1836.jpg)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Cole_Thomas_The_Course_of_Empire_Destruction_1836.jpg)

Perhaps, but there is nothing unique about the current shift in consumer attention from desktop to mobile. Past examples include:

 * **Telegraphs**, a network-layer technology that created many new opportunities for telegraph operators, but hurt the steam ship operators carrying letters across the Atlantic.
 * **3G data networks**, a network-layer technology that enabled users of WhatsApp and other messaging applications to bypass [exorbitant SMS fees][5].
 * **Cell phone cameras**, a hardware-layer technology that enabled consumers to share single photos as they were taken, rather than wait until they were at a computer to upload an album, thus altering the market for photo-sharing applications.
 * **Address book APIs**, an OS-layer technology that let applications request access to the contacts on a user's device, and then match those names/emails/phone numbers with other uploaded address books to automatically find the new user's friends, thus undermining Facebook's monopoly on the social graph[^4].

In each case the changes in underlying technology enabled new consumer behaviors and disrupted old monetization strategies, but it is difficult for established companies to anticipate these changes and execute accordingly. Timing and branding are important, as evidenced by Facebook's [Poke][6], a clone of Snapchat that never gained marketshare. In order for Facebook to remain the dominant social network, they have to anticipate and execute on *every* change, and each innovation that gets made elsewhere is like a rebellious province that gains independence. Facebook also can't rely on network effects between users to protect its borders -- [Albert Wenger from Union Square Ventures has said][7] that network effects "work very well on the way up, but they also work very well on the way down."

The current mobile devices are certainly not the apex of communication technology. For example, regardless of the whether Google can foster [healthy social conventions around][8] [Glass][9], it's clear that we will have wearable communication devices, and that those devices will enable yet-to-be-imagined application-layer user experiences. There will be many future technologies after Glass at the network, hardware, and OS layers, and each will destabilize the application layer where Facebook has built its empire. Each product that Facebook builds makes it harder for them to add new products, both from the perspective of the organization (more teams with vested interests, more products to support/integrate) and the users (more confusing user experiences, more complicated relationships with the brand). Decomissioning old products is hard for similar reasons.

This recurring challenge is related to [Clay Christensen's Innovator's Dilemma][10]: established firms are vulnerable to smaller companies with disruptive and low-margin technologies that, over time, become profitable and overtake those of the established firms. Should Facebook spend resources developing for wearable devices, and risk being too early or building the wrong thing? Or should they wait until the market is established and the interaction paradigms proven, and risk being too late? The barbarians are independent, so each can try a different approach, but a sprawling empire must choose its strategies more carefully.

These questions are not particular to Facebook and its products and strategies, but rather fundamental to the market for communication technology. Facebook, [mired by their secrets][11] and moored by a billion users clicking on advertisements and Like buttons, will not be the last great social network, although they may still make a lot more money and might never disappear completely. Nor will Facebook be the second-to-last great social network -- whatever company comes next will face all of the same challenges, and will eventually be replaced for the same reasons. As [Zuckerberg said][12] when asked if mobile phones were the future of Facebook, "They’re the future for now, but nothing is the future forever."

The only question is when. Each new great social network will look different from the previous great social network, because they will be built on a different stack of technologies. Each new great social network will be great for us, the users, because they will bring us ever closer to people who are far away.

*The paintings depict neither Facebook nor Ancient Rome (the last great civilization?), but rather an imaginary city. Titled *[The Consummation of Empire](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:The_Course_of_Empire_Consummation_Thomas_Cole_1835_1836.jpeg)*, *[Destruction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Cole_Thomas_The_Course_of_Empire_Destruction_1836.jpg)* and *[The Arcadian or Pastoral State](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Cole_Thomas_The_Course_of_Empire_The_Arcadian_or_Pastoral_State_1836.jpg)*, respectively, they were painted by [Thomas Cole](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Cole) from 1833-36 as part of his five-part series *[The Course of Empire](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Course_of_Empire)*.*

[^1]: The layer terminology was inspired by Steve Cheney's differentiation between application and infrastructure layers in [Google Voice and FaceTime – Why the Carriers Are Losing Their Voice](http://techcrunch.com/2010/11/07/google-voice-and-facetime-why-the-carriers-are-losing-their-voice/), but there are also clear similarities to the seven-layer [OSI model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven-layer_model) (which does not [refer to a burrito](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fow7iUaKrq4&t=1m49s)).

[^2]: There are *many* messaging apps similar to WhatsApp, including: [Line](http://line.naver.jp/en/) (mentioned later), [WeChat](http://wechat.com/en/), [Kakao Talk](http://www.kakao.com/talk/en), [Kik](http://kik.com/), [Hike](http://get.hike.in/), [Path](https://path.com/), and [MessageMe](http://messageme.com/).

[^3]: Snapchat is currently valued at [$860 million](http://www.forbes.com/sites/jjcolao/2013/06/24/snapchat-raises-60-million-from-ivp-at-800-million-valuation/), and WhatsApp is perhaps worth [$1.1 billion](http://stevecheney.posterous.com/facebook-and-whatsapp-whats-a-consumer-networ), so Facebook could probably just buy them both and be done with it... but they cannot afford to do that with every successful competitive app forever. Furthermore, just as Facebook declined early acquisition efforts, these new companies may simply be unwilling to sell at a reasonable price.

[^4]: Address book matching has been around for a while, but has recently become increasingly common. It was perhaps [pioneered by Kik](http://venturebeat.com/2010/11/03/kik-messenger-sees-explosive-start-a-mobile-chat-better-than-sms/), and [Path was fined by the FTC](http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2013/02/path.shtm) for automatically collecting this data. [Josh Miller](https://twitter.com/joshm) has written more recently about this new social graph portability [here](https://medium.com/musings-about-text-boxes/8157c364d26a).
