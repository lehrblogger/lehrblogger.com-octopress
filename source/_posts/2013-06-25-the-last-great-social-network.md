Was Ancient Rome[^1] the last great empire? Or perhaps it was the Mongol Empire founded by Genghis Khan? Maybe it will be the United States of America?

Was Bell the last great telephone company? Was AOL the last great Internet Service Provider? Was Geocities the last great web host? Is the New York Times the last great source of news? Is craigslist the last great marketplace?

There persists a general sense in the startup community that Facebook is the last great social network. It’s so big and there are such strong network effects – how could there be room for anything new? But if we look at the history of organizations in general, the actual trends in the market, and the progression of communication technologies, then it’s clear this the status quo will not last. There's no such thing as the last great anything.

Somehow, once-small social networks such as [Instagram][1], [Pinterest][2], [Snapchat][3], and [WhatsApp][4] all gained market share. Incumbents can sometimes copy or acquire such upstarts, but not always. The current "last great social network" achieved that status by competing successfully against, and declining acquisition offers from, the previous incumbents. The next great social network will do the same.

The thing that replaces Facebook will not look like Facebook. Social networks are fundamentally about communicating with people who are somewhere other than where we are, and these technologies have continually improved. Two hundred years ago, if you wanted to communicate with someone far away, you had to write a letter. If the other person was across the Atlantic, the letter was sent on a ship that might take months to reach its destination. Yet everything changed after the first steamship crossed the ocean in 1819, and again when the first telegraph cable was laid in 1858, and so on.

Communication technologies are constantly improving, and thus the application layer through which we actually communicate is constantly in flux. The browser-based Internet on which Facebook is dominant is just the most recent in a long line of technologies that includes boats, airplanes, letters, email, rotary telephones, Polaroid cameras, and iPhones. This progression will continue, and soon we will have [Google Glass][5], [the Myo][6], and perhaps [Apple's rumored watch][7]. The thing that replaces Facebook will not look like Facebook, because it will be built on different technologies.

Furthermore, new technologies have a history of disrupting the status quo: email is steadily driving the postal service into bankruptcy, cell phones are replacing landlines, and iMessage is automatically drawing users away from SMS. In addition, those technologies can have secondary disruptive effects on established institutions: the printing press enabled Martin Luther to distribute the 95 Theses, which in turn helped initiate the Protestant Reformation, and as a result Roman Catholicism was not the last great religion.

These trends will continue, and the incumbents, [mired by their secrets][8] and moored by billions of users clicking on advertisements and Like buttons, will be too slow to adapt. Only startups can keep up with the inevitable future, and only startups can shape and profit from that future. The time is now to start building because of, not despite, the size and inertia of the most recent great social network. As the first rays of new communication technologies peek over the time horizon, the fog of that social network will burn away.
