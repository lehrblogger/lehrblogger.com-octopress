On the surface, Twitter is doing wonderfully well. They have over 230 million active users, and [growth is healthy][1]. In two months their stock rose to [more than double][2] [the IPO price][3], and there are [new advertising opportunities][4] they are just beginning to explore. Both consumers and brands view the product as a global town square where people find news, ideas, and lightweight conversation.

Yet [a horde of upstart messaging apps][5] pose a growing threat to Twitter. [Snapchat][6], [WhatsApp][7], [Kik][8], [WeChat][9], [Line][10], and [Kakao][11] each have at least 100 million users, and pose an existential threat to Twitter. This is a classic example of [disruptive innovation][12], as described by Clayton Christensen in his book [The Innovator's Dilemma][13]. If you're unfamiliar, watch the first ten minutes of this talk, but skip the two-minute intro music!

Twitter has had a barebones messaging feature since it launched in 2006, but for years Direct Messages have been hidden in their website and apps. Twitter ignored messaging because it was a commodity feature that was not central to their core broadcasting product, and because it had been historically difficult to monetize. As Christensen might predict, Twitter seemed happy to let those other companies relieve them of the least profitable part of their product, so that they could better focus on what was important to the business.

Meanwhile, the aforementioned messaging apps grew like innovative weeds. Snapchat pioneered [ephemeral social media][14], Line showed that sales of virtual [stickers could generate substantial revenue][15] (and others promptly copied them), and WhatsApp has shown that people would actually pay money for social apps ([$0.99/year][16] adds up over [400 million users][17]). More problematically for Twitter, these apps are branching out into other aspects of social networking: Snapchat recently launched [a broadcast feature called Stories][18], Kik is pushing [a platform that enables third-parties to develop social apps][19], and WeChat offers [a Twitter-like Moments feature][20]. These apps are all moving upmarket into Twitter's profitable social/information broadcasting territory.

Twitter, to its credit, has recently tried to move its messaging product back downmarket. They [resurrected DMs][21] with support for photos and a more prominent placement, but they're [still bizarrely tied to Twitter's follow graph][22], despite [experiments with fewer restrictions][23][^1]. These efforts are misdirected, however: Twitter users think of DMs as a last-resort communication method, used only when the matter is urgent (traditionally, DMs would trigger in-app, email, and SMS notifications) or when the sender has no other way of contacting the recipient. And even with the recent changes, Twitter is still thinking of DMs as email, merging the email envelope icon with the messaging chat bubble icon in their new iOS tab bar:

{% img ios_tab_bar /images/2014/01/twitter_tab_bar.png %}

The upstart messaging apps are successful, however, precisely because they are *not* email. DMs must be 'composed', since it takes extra effort to break up a thought into 140-character snippets, while the messaging apps try to replicate the casual, instantaneous nature of face-to-face interaction. Typing notifications, for example, create a sense of mutual presence and attention, while stickers convey emotion when body language cannot.

While Twitter could continue to iterate on DMs until it reached feature parity with the other messaging apps, that could overcomplicate the current product. Sometimes people go to Twitter to find out ["what's happening"][24], but sometimes people go to Twitter to talk to other people, and these distinct use cases would be better served by distinct apps. Rather than struggle to teach an old feature new tricks, Twitter should create a new product to compete with the other messaging apps[^2].

Fortunately for Twitter, there are several aspects of it's current products it can leverage to create a differentiated experience. What should Twitter's messaging app look like, and how should it work? For the purposes of discussion, let's call this new app "Twig."

{% img iphone left  /images/2014/01/twig_contacts_standard.png TODO: add wireframe with standard contact list %}
{% img iphone right /images/2014/01/twig_conversation_standard.png TODO: add wireframe with standard conversation view for a group %}

##### Leverage the Existing Social Graph

Most messaging apps rely on users' address books to bootstrap their networks[^3], but Twitter's social graph is uniquely based on each individual's interests. Because the graph is asymmetric, users can follow whomever they find interesting, regardless of whether the interest is reciprocated. As a result [the network becomes *aspirational*][25] â€“ users follow the people they wish they knew. Twitter allows you to stumble across someone new, learn about their interests gradually, and interact casually through @-replies. It's natural for users to want to strengthen these relationships further through lightweight, synchronous, private conversations, so Twitter should provide that social space as well[^4].

{% img iphone right /images/2014/01/twig_contacts_twitter.png TODO: wireframe of contact list sorted by Twitter interactions %}

This use case fits neatly into Twig's Contacts tab, which can include people that the user follows on Twitter in addition to the standard selection of contacts from the device address book. That list can even be auto-sorted by the amount and recency of the user's Twitter interactions with those contacts -- she's more likely to message the contacts whose tweets she favorites regularly or the contacts with whom she exchanges more @-replies.

Users would not want to receive Twig messages from *anyone*, however, so some sort of permissioning is necessary. Messaging is about conversation, so there's no point in a user being able to contact someone who can't respond. Rather than overburden their existing interest-based follow graph, Twitter should create a separate social graph of the people that can exchange messages on Twig. Users could add other users as contacts, perhaps accompanied by an optional public @-reply explaining the request. If the recipient approves the request, the two users could then exchange messages. While Twig's graph could be bootstrapped off the of the existing follow graph, it would diverge over time. It's also important that each user's list of approved/blocked contacts is private, unlike public follows.

##### Seed Conversations with Tweets

{% img iphone right /images/2014/01/twig_conversation_twitter.png TODO: wireframe of conversation with pulled in Tweets, both public and @-reply %}

Because Twig integrates with Twitter, it can automatically display tweets from a conversation's participants in the conversation itself. This adds context to the conversation, and makes it easy for users to discuss specific tweets or to jump back and forth between the public and private conversation spaces.

At a glance, it might seem like Twig competes with Twitter's existing @-replies, but this should not be a concern. While @-replies are great for many things, there are several restrictions that make them unsuitable for real conversation. First, the character limit makes it difficult to compose messages, slowing down an otherwise free-flowing exchange. Second, the character limit puts a cap on the number of participants, since the more people there are, the harder it is to fit the message in a tweet. Third, users have different notification settings for different types of @-replies, making it difficult to know if/when the other participants will respond. Finally, the reverse-chronological feed with new messages at the top is awkward for long conversations, which traditionally occur in chronological feeds with new messages at the bottom[^5]. Because of these restrictions, it's more likely that Twig would, as Christensen would say, "compete with non-consumption" -- Twig would enable conversations that wouldn't otherwise happen on Twitter at all.

##### Prefer Private to Public

{% img iphone right /images/2014/01/twig_conversation_discoverable.png TODO: wireframe of conversation view toggled-to-public, @-reply in compose %}

Twig conversations should be private by default so that the provide a social space comparable to the messaging apps with which it would be competing. There's a temptation to make conversations either public, like in @-reply threads where non-participant friends can see the entire conversation history and jump in at-will. Public histories, however, force participants to censor themselves because they don't know who might be listening; if users want that type of conversational space, than the existing @-replies are good enough.

Twig might benefit from discoverable conversations that are similar to those on Dashdash, where users can see what conversations their friends are having, but not what they're saying (as they can with @-replies) until they join that conversation. While Dashdash is used primarily on desktops and laptops, Twig would primarily be a mobile application, where availability for a conversation is more context- and topic-dependent. As a result, it makes more sense to let Twig users enable this discoverability on a conversation-by-conversation basis. 

If a Twig conversation *has* been specified as discoverable, then participants might want to encourage their friends to join the conversation. From discoverable rooms, Twig users would be able to tweet a link to the Twig conversation, and followers who clicked it would enter directly into a browser-based chat room. If those followers are already logged in to Twitter in that browser, then they would also already be logged into Twig and could have a seamless experience[^6].

##### Use Twitter as a Platform for Growth

Because users will have to download Twig in addition to Twitter, adoption amongst new users will be gradual, and thus it's important that users have a good Twig experience before the rest of their contacts are on the service. Other social services, such as Instagram and Vine, used Twitter to solve this problem and grow quickly by making it easy for users to tweet their content. 

While Twig can partially adopt this strategy with the aforementioned tweetable links to conversations, it could also degrade gracefully to Twitter DMs. If a Twig user wanted to send a message to a non-Twig user, then the sender's messages could simply be received as DMs (assuming the recipient already follows the sender on Twitter). Perhaps these messages could be preceded by an automated header from Twitter, explaining Twig and inviting the recipient to download the app. This backwards compatibility would both accelerate Twig's growth and make the app immediately fun for new users.

##### Summary

Snapchat, WhatsApp, Kik, WeChat, Line, and Kakao are growing quickly despite their focus on the generally-unappealing messaging market. As they grow, they have begun to move upmarket into the status broadcasting features core to Twitter, and it's important to Twitter's long-term success that they defend and develop their products accordingly. By leveraging the existing social graph, seeding conversations with tweets, focusing on private interactions, and using Twitter as a platform for growth, Twitter could create the compelling and viable messaging product they need.

[^1]: This limitation in and of itself dooms DMs as a competitor to other messaging apps. Twitter can either be a place where you follow the people you're interested in, or a place where you follow the people you want to talk with, but it can't be both. Until it resolves this issue, the subtle social friction and persistent fear of embarrassment will drive users to other messaging products.

[^2]: Why Twitter, and not a third-party client application? While all of the functionality I describe could be built using the publicly-available APIs, [Twitter has been clear to discourage applications that allow consumers to engage with the core Twitter experience](https://dev.twitter.com/blog/changes-coming-to-twitter-api); Twig falls squarely in that upper-right quadrant. An enterprising third party might be able to get Twitter to grant more than the default 100,000 API tokens, but it would be imperative that the short-term and the long-term incentivizes of both companies were aligned. For the purposes of this post, it seemed simpler to assume that Twitter was as tied to Twig as they are to, say, Vine.

[^3]: Users allow these services to have access to the names, emails, and phone numbers stored in their address books, and then the service can match those identifiers across users to quickly and automatically build a reasonably-accurate social graph. This results in connections that are often similar to Facebook's, but without the years of painstakingly sent and accepted Friend requests.

[^4]: Dashdash, the messaging app I've been working on, provided exactly this sort of social space. Several of my private beta users had only previously known each other through Twitter, but were able to converse freely on Dashdash without needing to exchange additional contact information. While this was not one of the primary features I had in mind when designing the product, it's one of the things that my users have enjoyed the most.

[^5]: Twitter has recently worked to bring continuity to conversations by adding 'blue lines' between @-replies in the home feed and by showing all threaded @-replies on tweet detail pages. While these changes make it easier for users to catch up on a conversation that's already happened, they don't make it easier to participate in a conversation as it's happening.

[^6]: It would also be interesting to make it easy for users to cross-post messages from Twig back to Twitter. Perhaps if a user long-pressed on one of their sent Twig messages, then a modal dialogue would appear showing that message as one or more tweets, combined with the usernames of the participants and a link to the conversation. It also might be interesting to let Twig users tweet directly from the message compose text box as they were sending messages to the conversation, but that would probably create too much noise on Twitter.
