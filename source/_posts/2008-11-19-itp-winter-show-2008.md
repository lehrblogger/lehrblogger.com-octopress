> Founded in 1979 as the first graduate education program in  
> alternative media, ITP has grown into a living community of  
> technologists, theorists, engineers, designers, and artists. This  
> two-year graduate program gives 220 students the opportunity to  
> explore the imaginative uses of communications technologies — how  
> they augment, improve, and bring delight and creativity into people’s  
> lives.
> 
> Housed in the studios of NYU's Tisch School of the Arts, ITP takes a  
> hands-on approach. Students learn to realize their ideas through a  
> hands-on approach of building, prototyping, and testing with people.
