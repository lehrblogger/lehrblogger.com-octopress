ANIMATE ON HOVER

I love instant messaging and the friends I talk with there, but it's time to update the chat bubbles and buddy lists that I've been using since I begged my parents for AOL in 1998.

So, I'm building Dashdash.

Conversation isn't just a feature of products that focus on micro-blogging, photo-sharing, social bookmarking, or etc. Rather, those things serve our desire to connect with each other, and the synchronous conversation, the real-time back-and-forth that all of this content inspires, is what builds friendships. That's the feature.

Are you also passionate about IM? Or interested in building distributed messaging systems? Get in touch.

Founder
Dashdash (formerly Vine.IM)
April 2012 â€“ Present (1 year 4 months)Greater New York City Area
Dashdash.com is instant messaging re-imagined to feel more like the real world.

Using XMPP/Jabber as my starting point, I've been building a service with light-weight group chat, ambient conversational context, and a zero-maintenance social graph. Dashdash is like a cocktail party on the Internet, and is currently in private beta.

Project Description
I'm building an instant messaging service where users can see that their friends are chatting, but not what they're saying unless they join those conversations.

It's built on top of XMPP/Jabber, so it works with existing chat clients such as Adium (pictured above, http://adium.im), iChat/Messages, Pidgin, and IM+.

I'm working on this because I want it to exist. I've loved instant messaging since I begged my parents for AOL in 1998, and I love spending time with groups of friends and collaborating with groups of coworkers. Dashdash brings these things together.

In the long term, reality will be augmented, not split into real and virtual worlds. Hardware will be commoditized, but application-layer market share will go to products with simple social experiences, and not to incumbents (e.g. Facebook could not beat Twitter, Instagram, or Snapchat). Communication platforms will help us *be* somewhere other than where we are and share the social, informational, and spatial contexts for the conversations we're having.

I'm looking for a co-founder at least as technical as myself to help prepare the app for a public beta, integrate with other social services, and build custom mobile/web/desktop clients. Most importantly, I'm looking for someone passionate and excited about this space.
Project Goals
Build an open-source browser extension to let Gchat users add generic XMPP services to the existing Gmail client.
Build a chat server that both implements Dashdash's unique group dynamic and federates with other XMPP services.
Build an iOS app targeted at current students who want to feel more connected to their friends.
