[Dashdash][1][^1] is a messaging app that helps us feel more like we're *with* people who are far away. It's a shared space online where we can socialize and collaborate in lightweight, ad-hoc groups, much like we do in real life at cocktail parties, school cafeterias, coffee shops, professional conferences, and office water coolers.

People regularly gather into groups that are too large for a single conversation, so instead we break up into smaller clusters. We can look around the space, see which people are having which conversations, and join whichever conversation we choose. The things we say in these real-life conversations are private to those present at the time; as people come and go, the participants can adjust their behavior accordingly. 

The dynamics of these social spaces emerge from the fundamental characteristics of humans and the world in which we live: how our voices carry through the air, how our bodies occupy space, how we recognize the faces of those nearby, and so on. These interactions feel rich and natural because they *are* rich and natural, by their very essence.

Dashdash emulates these real-world social spaces. It's in private beta and under active development, but right now it's an instant messaging service built on top of the XMPP/Jabber standard. This means Dashdash works with *existing* client apps[^2] that people already use across a variety of platforms. These apps all support multiple accounts, so users just need to add their Dashdash account alongside their Gchat, AIM, and other accounts. The below screencast shows the basic features in the [Adium client][2], and is about 90 seconds long:

<div class="screencast">
<a href="/images/2013/07/screencast.gif" target="_blank" class="front">Hover or click to watch the screencast.</a>
<a href="/images/2013/07/screencast.gif" target="_blank" class="back"></a>
</div>

As you can see above, Dashdash creates two new groups in the user's contact list. Together, these two groups constitute the shared social space described above. Similarly to other messaging services, in the **Dashdash Contacts** group, Alice (the signed-in user) can see the people she knows who are currently online and available to chat[^3]; it's like a list of everyone who is in the current social space. The **Dashdash Conversations** group has a list of all of the conversations that Alice can see, including the ones that she's participating in to help her remember that her friends can see her conversations too; it's like a list of all of the clusters of people in the current space.

All that Alice needs to do to join a converasation is send a message to the appropriate item in her contact/buddy list. She can't see what was said before she arrived, and she won't know what will be said after she leaves, just as if she had walked up to a conversation in real life. It's not scalable for everyone to see *every* conversation, of course, so Alice can only see the Dashdash conversations that her friends are in. Because each two-person conversation can seamlessly become a group conversation, groups can form organically based on the interests of the participants. This is in contrast to how group messaging works on existing services:

<div class="iphone"><img src="/images/2013/07/market1.png"><img src="/images/2013/07/market2.png"></div>

The market for messaging is crowded preicsely *because* it is unsolved, and none of these services model how conversations actually work in social spaces in the real world. Some, such as Facebook Chat[^4] and Google Hangouts/Gchat require that group participants explicitly invite others to the conversation, but it's too much work to know who to invite, when to invite them, and to which conversations. Other services, such as Facebook and Twitter[^5], make the entire conversation public, forcing participants to perform for an unseen audience. Still others, such as Hipfire, Campfire, and IRC (not shown above), rely on pre-defined &#39;rooms&#39; that users can join at will, but that are unable to adapt to side conversations.

While this early version of Dashdash is uniquely useful for groups of friends and co-workers, there's much more to build. When people are in a face-to-face conversation, there's an incredible amount of information being exchanged and shared other than the words that each is speaking. Each participant is aware of the others' intonation, facial expressions[^6], and body language as well as the context for the conversation. That shared context can include aspects of the physical space, activity, and social situation.

In the short term, Dashdash would benefit most from a Gmail/Gchat-compatible browser extension[^7] and custom mobile apps for iOS and Android, but in the medium term, Dashdash will communicate more of these shared contexts to conversation participants. Data and data exhaust from other services can help each participant understand the shared contexts for the conversation: *Where is each particpant? Who else is in the same (physical) place? Where is their attention? What other desktop/mobile applications are they actively using? What was their most recent tweet or code check-in?* The more ambient context the participants share for a conversation, the more rich and natural that conversation can feel.

Communications technology will continue to improve until our face-to-face conversations are indistinguishable from those with people who are far away. These improvements will create [recurring opportunities for new social applications][3], and in the long term Dashdash will expand to support photo, voice, and video messaging on emergent platforms such as Google Glass[^8]. The vision for Dashdash is telepresence in the strongest sense of the word: the ability to *be* somewhere other than where we are.

[^1]: The name Dashdash was inspired by [Morse Code](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code), in which &#34;&#45;&#45;&#34;  is the letter &#34;m&#34;, but it's also short, memorable, and fun to say. The app was previously called Vine.IM, but a few months later Amazon-owned Quidsi bought the [owned-but-unused Vine.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20110202113611/http://vine.com/vine/Vine_Technology.html) and launched [a retail site for environmentally-friendly home products](http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/26/amazon-starts-a-shopping-site-for-the-environmental-crowd/), dashing my hopes for buying it myself after raising venture capital. Around that time [Twitter bought another startup](http://allthingsd.com/20121009/twitter-buys-vine-a-video-clip-company-that-never-launched/) called Vine.co that was building a video sharing service, and for a while it looked like they might [use the name Ver.se](/images/2013/07/verse.png). When they [launched under the Vine name](http://blog.twitter.com/2013/01/vine-new-way-to-share-video.html), I knew it was time to re-brand.

[^2]: Supported XMPP/Jabber apps include:<ul><li>Mac OS X: [Adium](http://adium.im/), [iChat/Messages](http://www.apple.com/osx/apps/#messages)</li><li>iOS: [IM+](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/im+-instant-messenger/id285688934%22), [imo](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/imo-messenger/id336435697)</li><li>Android: [Xabber](http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.xabber.android), [Beem](http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.beem.project.beem)</li><li>Windows: [Pidgin](http://www.pidgin.im/)</li><li>Web: [imo.im](http://imo.im/)</li></ul>I don't own an Android device, so haven't been able to test those apps. Email me at [lehrburger@gmail.com](mailto:lehrburger@gmail.com) if they work, or if you have any trouble!

[^3]: In mobile apps, the notion of status/presence becomes considerably more nuanced. Rather than the available, idle, away, and offline states that are supported by XMPP, mobile users are in some sense *always* available, and I'll need to update Dashdash accordingly.

[^4]: It was [recently leaked](http://techcrunch.com/2013/06/27/facebook-chat-rooms/) that Facebook was working on browsable chat rooms similar to those in Dashdash. The design of Facebook's social graph, however, encourages users to oversasturate their networks over time, and as a result Facebook users will be less comfortable making their conversations visible to all of their friends. Alternatively Facebook could make conversations visible to subsets of the users' friends, but if they do this algorthmically then users won't know who is nearby and won't feel comfortable, and if they rely on Lists then they present users with [a large, tedious project](http://localhost:4000/2011/07/06/the-problem-with-circles-and-the-pleasure-of-carbon-copy/). Also, historically, Facebook has not been able to introduce new features within their bloated platform that compete successfully with more nimble startups.

[^5]: Twitter users can create a somewhat similar social environment with @-replies between protected accounts, but the privacy model is still bizarrely different from that in the real world: if a user approves a follow request, then the new follower will be able to see that user's @-replies for the present conversation as well as all past and future conversations. I plan to write an in-depth analysis of conversation on Twitter in an upcoming post.

[^6]: Messaging interfaces do, to an increasing extent, let users communicate their facial expressions and emotions using icons and images. People have been using typographical marks to represent faces and emotions [for a long time](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoticon#History), but recently apps have been [offering more detailed stickers](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324069104578531820453319946.html). These stickers, perhaps pioneered by [Japanese messaging app Line](http://line.naver.jp/en/), portray animated characters expressing a variety of emotions, and users can send them to others to wordlessly express how they feel.

[^7]: I plan to write about how this browser extension might work in a second upcoming post. In short: users will authorize with one or more XMPP/Jabber accounts in the extension settings, and then they'll see their online contacts and message windows alongside the Gchat/Hangouts contacts and message windows in Gmail in the browser. This would be a way for people to use Dashdash without downloading a separate application, but because Dashdash follows the XMPP/Jabber standard, the extension could be open source project that was useful to other services as well.

[^8]: In yet *another* upcoming post, I plan to write about what a social network might look like that was native to Google Glass.
