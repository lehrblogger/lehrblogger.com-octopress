We look away from the limitations of the mouse, keyboard and monitor interface of today's computers, and start instead with the expressive capabilities of the human body. We consider uses of the computer for more than just information retrieval and processing, and at locations other than the home or the office. The platform for the class is a microcontroller, a single-chip computer that can fit in your hand. The core technical concepts include digital, analog and serial input and output. Core interaction design concepts include user observation, affordances, and converting physical action into digital information. Students have weekly lab exercises to build skills with the microcontroller and related tools, and longer assignments in which they apply the principles from weekly labs in creative applications. Both individual work and group work is required.		  		  		  		  		  		   <a href="http://itp.nyu.edu/physcomp " target="_top">Syllabus</a> </td></tr></table><br><h2>TIER 2</h2></font><font size = +1> 1', 2', 10'<br></font> <table  border="0"><tr><td ><font size = 2>H79.2768.1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nick  Bilton &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Thur 12:30pm to 3:00pm  </font></td> <a name="1152"> </a></tr></table><table  border="0"><tr><td><font size = 1> User Interface (U.I.) isn't just an exploration of good design - either on screen or in a hardware - it's increasingly becoming a transformation of input based user interaction; the UI of an iPhone application, allowing multi-touch and access to a variety of sensors differs from that of a Television with limited inputs, computer with keyboard and other inputs, or a newly created device. As the available inputs and UI changes with each device, so does the content, design limitations and the narrative.  We currently live in a world where we interact with content in 3 main environments 1 foot - cell phone/ipod, 2 foot - computer, and 10 foot - television and with each of these devices we have to accommodate our content and interaction accordingly, and allow for the content to follow you between these devices, but maintain a classic & intuitive user experience. This course looks at these problems on a per-project basis and looks to solve them at a granular level. The class is a mix of hands on problem solving based around current student projects, and lectures exploring real world experiences in these scenarios and why some of them work, and most of them don't.

Claude Levi-Strauss' observation that "Animals are Good to Think" is the starting point from which we make, discuss, and examine the ways in which art works imagine the interrelationships between the human, the animal, and our environment. If we can only perceive these things through mediation (media representations), then how we represent them is the fundamental question, reflecting our ideologies, prejudices, hopes, and fears.  Do we speak for animals, and if so what are we saying for them? Are they friends, pets, environmental equals or beasts? How are hybrid monsters (chimera) created and what do they mean? How do we understand our places as subjects in a landscape or a datascape? How can anthropomorphic cuteness be subversive? This class focuses on questions of intention, relation, and subjectivity, through critical engagement with representations of people, animals, monsters, and mutants, in their respective environments. The class is further focused on the use of character in context, via toy design, robotics, animation, video, image generation or data visualization. There are introductory texts on character development, and generally an emphasis on literary, philosophical and natural history texts, including Jorge Luis Borges, John Berger, Giorgio Agamben, Donna Haraway, Rebecca Solnit, Steve Baker, Deleuze & Guattari.  Assignments include studio work and readings. There is more emphasis on the development and analysis of ideas, and less emphasis on particular media or forms. Students make several short projects, backed up by readings and research into precedent art works. There is a final project.  Class is a combination of studio critique, responses to art works, reading and discussion.

representations, and data. What does it mean to use the "scientific method"? What is the purpose and value of data produced in experiments? How true are representations crafted with data, and who wants or needs to know about scientific results? What do we gain by incorporating scientific data or visualization into our own work? The course focuses on cases from emerging and converging scientific and technological fields: nano, info, & bio. The goal is to cultivate purposeful science communication and to encourage critical responses to scientific and technological practice in modern culture. Over the course of the class, each student focuses on a particular area of science and becomes familiar with its process, language, and data. To do this, we get some first hand experience unpacking particular visualizations, talking with scientists and students of scientific disciplines, and interviewing members of our potential audiences. Who produces and analyses data, what are they looking for in their results? Who else is interested in understanding data --in what setting, through what medium or interface? From these direct experiences, we propose our own art/science collisions: using artistic sensibilities and media tools to communicate about the scientific process, contextualize and annotate visualizations, and frame our chosen topic for particular audiences: museum-goers, policy makers, the disabled, teachers, adults, or children. In periodic "science salons," we discuss our chosen areas of science, associated datasets and visualizations, affiliated scientists, and potential audiences. We formulate our own approach to communicating information about science, data, and the topics these inform. Students fully-develop one idea as a media/ interactive presentation for the final project, incorporating scientific data and framing the presentation for a select audience and setting.

From massively multiplayer online games to networked objects that turn the city into a gigantic game grid, new forms of super-sized gaming are expanding at an alarming rate and opening up vast new spaces in which to play. Whether these games are measured in terms of number of players, geographical dimensions, or temporal scope, they represent a new trend in which the "little world" created by a game threatens to swallow up the "real world" in which it is situated.  This class is a hands-on workshop that is focused on the particular design problems of large-scale games.  In this class students: develop a foundation of basic game design understanding from which to approach the specific issues particular to big games; analyze existing digital and non-digital large-scale games, taking them apart to understand how they work; as interactive systems; and work on a series of design exercises that explore the social, technological, and creative possibilities of large-scale games.  		  		  		   <a href="http://itp.nyu.edu/syllabus/NYU-Big_GamesSp09.pdf " target="_top">Syllabus</a> </td></tr></table><br></font><font size = +1> Computational Cameras<br></font> <table  border="0"><tr><td ><font size = 2>H79.2546.1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Dan  O'Sullivan &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Mon 11:00am to 1:55pm  </font></td> <a name="1067"> </a></tr></table><table  border="0"><tr><td><font size = 1> Computers should see.  We depend most heavily on light to sense the world.  As our experience is increasingly mediated through computers, it is not surprising that cameras have become an integral part of them.  As computers become small, cheap and ubiquitous in laptops, cellphones and microcontrollers the cameras attached to them can gain coverage of every corner of life.   This class looks at the possibilities and the computer software for getting a hold of the signals coming in from all these cameras.  The class first looks getting images, integrating multiple views and transmitting them over a network.  The class then turns to the more demanding programming required to process or analyzed the incoming image for such things as background removal, finding edges, for tracking objects.  As a sensor, the video camera is appealing; delivering up to 36 million bytes every second compared to maybe 3 bytes from a keyboard.  This requires a coding parsimony that can be used as a challenging exercise to improve a students general coding skills but the real difficulty of computer vision comes when you expect your software to be able to mimic the powers of the human brain to interpret arbitrary images.  This class attempts to side step these very difficult parts by working in fairly contrived environments such as art installations, eye tracking rigs, and ant farms.   The course uses Java in the Eclipse environment which is a good next step from the Processing environment.  We look at implementing these techniques across platforms, including the desktop, the cellphone and even on a microcontroller.   The class requires ICM or similar programming background.			  		   <a href="http://itp.nyu.edu/varwiki/Syllabus/Computational-Cameras-S08 " target="_top">Syllabus</a> </td></tr></table><br></font><font size = +1> Dataflow Programming for Projects<br></font> <table  border="0"><tr><td ><font size = 2>H79.2748.1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Hans-Christoph  Steiner &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Tues 3:30pm to 6:00pm  </font></td> <a name="1162"> </a></tr></table><table  border="0"><tr><td><font size = 1> Graphical dataflow programming languages like the Max family (Pd aka Pure Data, Max/MSP, jMax, etc.) provide a more intuitive approach to media creation and manipulation.

We start with the basics of Pd itself, and cover the basics of audio, video, 3D, physical computing, networking, and how to organize large projects.  Pd is free software, and also runs on embedded systems like PDAs and iPhones, providing possibilities previously only feasible using microcontrollers.  The Max paradigm is compared to object-oriented languages like Processing to provide an idea of their differences and similarities, as well as their respective strengths and weaknesses.  This course is structured around learning by doing, so students have regular assignments to explore the ideas covered in class, as well as a final project. The focus is on Pd, but much of this knowledge is applicable to Max/MSP as well.

Particular attention is given to social and community-based web interaction. The production environment consists of the MySQL database and the PHP programming language. Students can expect to develop a firm knowledge of database design and optimization, the SQL query language, and the use of PHP to create dynamic activity of both orthodox and unorthodox nature. Late-semester topics focus on interfacing this environment with other technologies such as JavaScript and Flash, along with data population and site architecture methodology. Introduction to Computational Media or equivalent programming experience is required. Students are also expected to have fluency in HTML or to come up to speed with it outside of class. Class requirements include homework assignments to reinforce each week's concepts while simultaneously contributing to the student's "toolkit" of code and design principles. There is also a midterm project, and a final project of the student's choosing.

This in turn has inspired the range of voices that have stepped forward to examine the phenomenon of games and its artifacts. In this class we survey the major work that has been done to understand games, both digital and traditional, in the past sixty years. Starting with foundational texts by historian Johan Huizinga and sociologist Roger Caillois, up to the present day where movements like 'New Games Journalism' seek to place games in the more personal context of a single human life. While the class seeks to understand games from theoretical and historical perspectives, the focus is on students bringing their own interpretations to bear. Through short essays and presentations students connect theory to real world examples and develop their own opinions and perspectives through discussion with other students. This class is for anyone interested in understanding the history of games and the enormous world of thought that surrounds them.

Without answers to these questions that people are seeking, there are limits to the role consumption can play in our shift to a more sustainable economic model. As product developers, designers, tinkerers, and technologists, we have the means to uncover these answers, and communicate the backstories of the things that we make. The objective of this course is to explore sustainable models, methods, and practices of both production and consumption. The class explores an interaction design model proposed by Bruce Sterling's Shaping Things, in which he implores, "Designers must design, not just for objects or for people, but for the technosocial interactions that unite people and objects." Additional content exposes students to the relationship between production, consumption, and impacts to the earth's ecosystem and human health. Students learn how to analyze product/service systems and are expected to perform a Life Cycle Analysis based on the Okala Design framework. Students also are asked to investigate and communicate a product backstory to an existing product. The final exercise of the course involves the creation of a new product/service system that provides a framework for users to affect and modulate the environmental and social impacts throughout their relationship with that object.

Does this signify a nascent 'information society' dependent on an 'information state' to regulate phenomenon such as 'net neutrality'? Information Contours explores the nature of the information flows that are generated by evolving, innovating, IT and the role of an emerging 'information state'.  For example, will the current economic crisis, with its collateralized debt obligations and credit default swaps, signal the onset of new digital economic information tools that will be government mandated to track risk and verify financial products?  As the variations of IT (computers, telephony, bio-engineering, software, ecology, DNA, surveillance, simulation, mapping, etc.) increase the quantity of, and applications for, information in society, the cultural, social, economic, political, legal, and ethical ramifications multiply. This class explores these interactions through diverse readings that stimulate class discussion of these exciting topics.  IT now suggests the contours that information assumes as the lifeblood of democracy.  Yet information, this assumed basic ingredient of democracy, is increasingly produced, manufactured, privatized, and marketed as a commodity.  What is "intellectual property" and what role does copyright and patent protection play in expanding or constricting accessible information?  Has the free flow of information been undermined by the increasing application and expansion of copyright and patent law to further the privatization, commodification and control of information?   As IT becomes more ubiquitous and embedded in culture, transformative issues arise as to its applicability, extension and direction.  Civil society is experiencing a shift in the value of information including its nomenclature, applications, and its normative function. Progress in IT increasingly focuses our attention on the way in which information influences culture and thereby informs contemporary democracy.  What is the relation between information flows, culture, economics, government, and democracy? Note: This two-point class meets every other Friday beginning January 23.

Generative Art creates a process of evolution. Where most art imitates life, generative art has a life of its own.  Generative methods have been chained to the personal computer for too long. What would happen if we took the algorithms employed in software art and applied them to the physical world through sensors and reactive elements? Or like Ned Kahn's piece "wind," apply laws of nature to physical works?  In this class we apply simple rules to dictate the shape or function of a work and add to it an inherent complexity that is both beautiful and intelligent. By combining the simple rules, or a system, with physical computing, we are marrying the work to the intention of the artist. This helps us define what we are doing when we create; it takes the assignments beyond exercises in executing basic electronics and drives it to an intention.  Living Art extracts the generative approach from the personal computer and applies it to the physical world. In some cases it is very clear how we can apply the Generative methods in the use of motors or light grids, but how do we apply fuzzy logic? This class is for students who have completed Introduction to Physical Computing.

This workshop aims to bring information sources we all care about into the mainstream. Our goal is to explore how selective streams of information can be sited and expressed in a way that not only creates engagement on the part of the viewer, but inspires action. 
Students work on a two-part semester-long design project based on an information source of their choice. Basic programming or action-script skills are required. The class is conducted as a design studio with bi-monthly critiques. It includes seminar discussions and guest visits by experts in the design profession. All aspects of visual communication are addressed, with an emphasis on typography, layout, color, and motion. Students need not have any formal design training, but should come with a particular interest in and commitment to honing their design skills.

In the spirit of transparency and ethical investigation, we explore approaches to subverting, upending and exposing our relation to such technologies. Furthermore, we examine the power of persuasive technologies in creating opportunities for communicating non-human intentions and viewpoints. Readings range from Douglas Adams on Genuine People Personalities, to Frank Herberts "Without Me, You're Nothing," Friedrich Juenger's "The Failure of Technology", to BJ Fogg, Nass and Rives, and the work in Critical Design by Dunne and Raby, among others.  Through class discussion, readings and examples we identify human emotional/social touchpoints: jealousy, seduction, fear, risk, reward, etc. Students conduct their own analyses of a manipulation technique, and of its corresponding persuasive technology application. For the second assignment students develop and present a persuasive technology concept for a non-human object or viewpoint. An example might be Play Coalition's "PlantBot," which puts plants in control of their own mobility based on their need for sunlight. For midterm, guest critics provide feedback to students' presentations of their final project concepts. Final projects can be developed in conjunction with other ITP course work, such as networked objects, social media, game design, physical computing, thesis, mobile computing; or a written research analysis.

researching various sensors and sensing methods and developing example
methods for their use. The class assembles a library of sensor
applications for interactive applications, and applies this research to
applications in other classes at ITP. The class begins with a review of
the electronics of sensor systems as learned in physical computing. From
there, we talk about types of sensors; sensors, time, and events;
amplification and filtering of sensor signals; sensor networks; data
processing, statistical methods, gesture recognition and related topics
that aid in making sensor systems effective. There are a number of
one-week exercises that students complete to demonstrate the techniques
discussed in class. In addition, students are responsible for a major
sensor research project in which they explain the operating principles of
a given sensor and present a working example of the sensor in use. These
research projects are presented throughout the second half of the
semester, and collected as part of a growing online reference project.
There is no final application project, but students are evaluated on the
application of their research (or that of other students) in production
projects developed for other classes.  Additionally, students are
evaluated by the level of thoughtfulness and detail put in to their
documentation.

The second, related question is, why do we function in groups. Group life is often unpleasant - it can be frustrating or boring in the extreme, and yet we often chose group membership over individual action when given the choice, whether on Monday morning or Friday night. What are the motivations that lead people to give up enough autonomy to participate in group action, either extrinsic (seeking fame and fortune) or intrinsic (feelings of accomplishment or appreciation of others.) Readings are drawn from classic sociological literature (Emil Durkheim, Mark Granovetter, Robert Axelrod) and from recent observations about mediated groups (danah boyd, Dan Hill, Clay Shirky); course work involves readings, class discussions, observation of existing groups, and three papers discussing the design of group interaction.

This course explores how interactive media can be integrated into physical spaces and furniture through the creative use of projectors and embedded displays. The course also examines the multitude of questions that arise when when designing for this type of media. Emphasis will be placed on the role of spatial and social context and the importance of relevant content within each of these environments. Technical topics include display integration techniques, vision-based sensing, physical sensing, and methods of fabrication. Students will work in pairs to complete two large projects over the course of the semester. These projects will be evaluated on both the quality of the design and the success of implementation. Additionally, there will be weekly assignments that challenge students to consider a wide variety of spaces that are ripe for transformation through the integration of digital media. Since this class will involve programming on an intermediate level, a working knowledge of Processing or C is a pre-requisite.

Through surveys, outside lectures and projects, we will question how our identity, ethnicity, and cultural footprint are reflected through our technology. We will consider how emerging technologies and movements, like open source, genetics, sustainable design, hacking, and wearable computing are impacting our expressions of identity. 
  
In the second portion of the course, we will focus on the intentional aspect of technology as identity. We will survey the globe for noteworthy new media art pieces that deliberately express cultural identity. We will pay particular attention to the contrast between North America and the Middle East, and possibly hold joint classes and collaborative projects with a design class at the American University of Beirut. There will be 3 assignments and one final project.

Even as our technologies become smaller and more versatile, we find ourselves bending down towards our keyboards and screens, and much of what we communicate with our bodies gets lost in translation. In Thinking Physically, we work to open ourselves back up and embrace the rich capabilities and inherent expressiveness of the human form. Starting with the body itself, we think about how it works and take a brief look at motion studies and biomechanics. Next, we examine how we use our bodies to relate to each other, considering physical social perceptions, proxemics, and cultural contexts. We then work to become better listeners, striving to sense the subtleties of body language, gesture, and nonverbal communication. Finally, it's time to put those listening skills to work, designing interfaces that perceive the body's communicative nature and encourage people to interact in a more physical way. Thinking Physically is a hands-on workshop in which we get up and move. Students create experiments and prototypes (both conceptual and technical) in response to weekly topics and design a body-centric final project based on what they've learned. Curated uses of the body (dance, physical comedy, sports, etc.), act as inspiration, but students focus on the everyman as the target user for the projects they create. With a toolbox of sensors, wearable techniques, and rugged interfaces in hand, we  capture and provoke full-bodied expression. By acknowledging and extending the body's impact, we create projects that appeal to the whole physical self.		  		    </td></tr></table><br></font><font size = +1> Toy Design Workshop<br></font> <table  border="0"><tr><td ><font size = 2>H79.2450.1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Daniel  Rozin &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Tues 3:30pm to 6:00pm  </font></td> <a name="1084"> </a></tr></table><table  border="0"><tr><td><font size = 1> Toys are an important element in the learning process of young children.

require a critical eye and technical challenges  demand a diverse combination of practical skills.  Making wearable technology has traditionally been difficult, but the availability of new tools, materials, and techniques has lately made the going a little easier. Wearables Studio is an intensive project development environment for students to create satisfying, expressive, wearable technologies that work.  We explore the available tools and techniques while developing
an understanding of the unique challenges and opportunities afforded by wearable technologies. Students develop a wearable technology concept, then refine, construct, and test their working prototype. Though we cover some of the theoretical points of wearable technologies, the class is production-oriented; you should have one or more projects in mind, one of which you will bring to completion over the course of the semester.

This class takes an analytical approach to unraveling and understanding these charged moments. In the process of the studying how and why strangers interact in public, we address some of the abiding themes at ITP - urban behavior, spontaneous interaction, the pleasure of the unexpected, how technology can mediate and/or enable human experience - and we make a close and thorough examination of how they play out in this narrow slice of human experience. This approach is designed to bring students to a more concrete understanding of these larger abstract ideas.  Classwork consists of readings, class discussions, field assignments (a series of assigned interactions with strangers that the students will document and discuss) and an analytical final paper. Students learn how the interactions of strangers have changed historically (and why), what the experience of interaction with strangers means to the participants, how strangers 'read' each other, how they initiate interactions, how they avoid interactions, how they trust each other and how they fool each other. Readings range from seminal works on urban sociology and public behavior (Georg Simmel, Stanley Milgram, Erving Goffman, Jane Jacobs, William H. Whyte, Elijah Anderson) to more lyrical examinations of strangers in cities (Tim Etchells, Italo Calvino, Roland Barthes, Walter Benjamin, Edgar Allan Poe) to recent neuropsychiatric discoveries about trust, mimicry, and flash judgments. Because stranger interactions are at heart a means to interrupt the expected narrative of the everyday, we consider the works of artists and thinkers who show how such disruption, surprise, spontaneity, and play are fundamental to the pleasure and substance of urban life, for example: the Situationists and their descendents, Sophie Calle, Marina Abramovic, Francis Alys, Graffiti Research Lab, Robert Rauschenberg, Survival Research Labs. We also explore recent art/technology projects that specifically engage strangers, such as Familiar Strangers, the Listening Station, PostSecret, Oddible, Loca: Set to Discoverable, Following/the Man in the Crowd, Mobile Feelings, and others.
